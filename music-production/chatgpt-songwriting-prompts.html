                    <h2>The "Co-Writer" Approach</h2>
                    <p>ChatGPT should not be seen as a replacement for the songwriter, but as a tireless co-writer.
                        Instead of asking it to "write a song," engage in a dialogue to refine specific elements. This
                        prevents the "AI-generic" feel and keeps your unique voice at the center.</p>

                    <h2>Creative Prompting Strategies</h2>
                    <p>Use these prompts to break through specific creative blocks:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Metaphor Deep-Dive:</strong> "Generate 10 metaphors for 'unanswered love' that use
                            architectural and urban planning terminology."</li>
                        <li><strong>Rhyme Scheme Variation:</strong> "I have a verse with an AABB scheme. Rewrite it
                            using an ABAB scheme while keeping the theme of 'nighttime solitude'."</li>
                        <li><strong>Narrative Arc:</strong> "Outline a 3-act story for a folk song about a clockmaker
                            who loses his sense of time."</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Generating Musical Structures</h2>
                    <p>ChatGPT is excellent at suggesting chord progressions based on emotional theory.</p>
                    <p><strong>Example Prompt:</strong> "Suggest a chord progression for a melancholic indie-rock bridge
                        that starts on the IV chord and builds tension using a diminished chord before resolving to the
                        V."</p>

                    <h3>🎨 Tip: Persona Prompting</h3>
                    <p>Ask ChatGPT to adopt a persona: "Act as a professional Nashville songwriter from the 1970s.
                        Critique these lyrics for emotional resonance and rhythmic flow."</p>
