                    <h2>The Best of Both Worlds</h2>
                    <p>Parallel processing (often called "New York Compression") involves blending a dry, unaffected
                        signal with a heavily processed version of the same signal. This allows you to add power,
                        weight, and grit without losing the "natural" dynamics and transients of the original sound.</p>
                </section>

                    <h2>Parallel Compression for Drums</h2>
                    <p>Try sending your whole drum bus to an auxiliary channel. Apply a compressor with a high ratio
                        (8:1 or more) and a fast attack to "obliterate" the transients. Then, slowly blend this
                        "smashed" signal back into your main drum mix. The result? A drum sound that is both explosive
                        *and* natural.</p>

                <section>
                    <h2>Parallel Saturation and Excitement</h2>
                    <p>Instead of putting a saturator directly on a vocal, use a parallel bus. Distort the parallel
                        signal heavily and filter out the low-end. When blended in, this adds "perceived loudness" and
                        brightness that makes the vocal cut through a dense mix like a knife.</p>

                    <h3>⚠️ Watch Out for Phase</h3>
                    <p>When using parallel processing, ensure your DAW's **delay compensation** is active. Even a tiny
                        timing difference between the dry and parallel signals can cause "comb filtering," making your
                        sound thin and hollow.</p>
