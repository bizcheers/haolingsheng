                    <h2>What is a PRO?</h2>
                    <p>A <strong>Performance Rights Organization (PRO)</strong> is a middleman that collects
                        <strong>public performance royalties</strong> on behalf of songwriters and music publishers.
                        Whenever your song is played in "public"—radio, TV, bars, restaurants, live concerts, and
                        digital streaming—you are legally entitled to a royalty. PROs ensure you actually get paid.
                    </p>

                    <p>In the United States, the three major players are <strong>ASCAP</strong>, <strong>BMI</strong>,
                        and <strong>SESAC</strong>. If you are a songwriter, you <strong>must</strong> be registered
                        with one of them to collect these royalties.</p>

                <section>
                    <h2>ASCAP (American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers)</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Structure:</strong> Non-profit, owned and run by its members (the songwriters).</li>
                        <li><strong>Cost:</strong> One-time fee (currently around $50-$100) for both writer and
                            publisher.</li>
                        <li><strong>Pros:</strong> Very transparent, great member benefits (including insurance and
                            discounts), and highly respected globally.</li>
                    </ul>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2>BMI (Broadcast Music, Inc.)</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Structure:</strong> For-profit (but traditionally operates as non-profit for
                            writers).
                            Founded by broadcasters.</li>
                        <li><strong>Cost:</strong> Free for songwriters (one-time fee for publishers).</li>
                        <li><strong>Pros:</strong> Excellent for new artists because it's free to join. Known for its
                            strong
                            support of newer music styles like Hip-Hop and Pop.</li>
                    </ul>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2>SESAC (Society of European Stage Authors and Composers)</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Structure:</strong> For-profit and <strong>invitation-only</strong>.</li>
                        <li><strong>Cost:</strong> None (if you are invited).</li>
                        <li><strong>Pros:</strong> Boutique experience. Since they have a smaller roster, they can
                            provide
                            more personal support and often negotiate higher rates for their members.</li>
                    </ul>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2>Which One Should You Join?</h2>
                    <p>For 99% of independent artists, the choice is between <strong>ASCAP</strong> and
                        <strong>BMI</strong>.
                        <br><br>
                        <strong>Join BMI if:</strong> You want a completely free entry with no upfront costs.
                        <br><br>
                        <strong>Join ASCAP if:</strong> You prefer a member-owned organization and plan to stay for the
                        long term.
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>Note:</strong> You cannot be a member of more than one PRO at the same time for the same
                        territory. Pick one and stick with it!</p>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2>Common Misconception: PROs vs. Publishing</h2>
                    <p>PROs <strong>only</strong> collect performance royalties. They do <strong>not</strong> collect
                        mechanical royalties (earned when your music is physically or digitally reproduced). To collect
                        <em>those</em>, you need a publishing administrator like <strong>Songtrust</strong> or
                        <strong>TuneCore Publishing</strong> in addition to your PRO.
                    </p>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                    <p>Registering with a PRO is one of the most important administrative steps in your music career.
                        It makes your music "professional" in the eyes of the law and ensures that every time your song
                        is heard by the public, money is flowing back to you.
                    </p>
