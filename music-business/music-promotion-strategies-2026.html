                    <p>The music industry has changed more in the last three years than in the previous thirty.
                        In 2026, a "good song" is only half the battle. To be heard, you must understand how
                        to navigate a world dominated by AI curators and short-form video. In this guide, we'll
                        break down the <strong>modern artist marketing</strong> playbook for independent creators.</p>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2>1. The "Vertical Video" First Strategy</h2>
                    <p>Whether it's TikTok, YouTube Shorts, or Instagram Reels, vertical video is the #1 way new
                        listeners discover music. Do not wait for your song to release to start posting.</p>
                    <div class="info-card">
                        <h4>The 3-Phase Video Plan:</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Pre-Release (2-3 weeks):</strong> Show the "making of" the song. Share the
                                struggle, the happy accidents, and the first "demo" listen.</li>
                            <li><strong>Launch Week:</strong> Use the "official" audio with high-energy visuals. Reply
                                to every comment in the first 2 hours.</li>
                            <li><strong>Post-Release:</strong> Share alternate versions (acoustic, sped-up,
                                slowed-reverb) and "meaning of the lyrics" videos.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2>2. Understanding AI Curators</h2>
                    <p>Spotify's <em>Discover Weekly</em> and <em>Release Radar</em> are driven by data. To trigger
                        the algorithm, you need "velocity"—a spike in saves, shares, and high-retention listens in
                        the first 72 hours. This is why <strong>pre-save campaigns</strong> are more important than
                        ever.</p>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2>3. Community vs. Following</h2>
                    <p>A "following" is passive; a "community" is active. Focus on "narrowcast" platforms like
                        Discord or private Telegram channels. High-value fans who pay for a direct connection
                        (via Patreon or Bandcamp) are worth more than 100,000 casual streamers.</p>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2>4. AI in Marketing</h2>
                    <p>Use AI tools to help you create content at scale. Tools that turn one long video into 10
                        short clips, or AI agents that help you draft email pitches to curators, are essential
                        for the "one-person" music business.</p>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2>Summary</h2>
                    <p>Music promotion in 2026 is an endurance sport. It's about consistent storytelling and
                        leveraging the power of the platforms. By treating your career as a media brand as much
                        as a musical project, you build the foundation for a sustainable, global career.</p>
