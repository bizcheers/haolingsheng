                    <h2>What is EQ?</h2>
                    <p>EQ (equalization) is basically a fancy volume control for different frequencies. Instead of just
                        turning everything up or down together, EQ lets you boost or cut specific frequency ranges. Want
                        more bass? Boost the low frequencies. Too much harshness? Cut the highs. It's that simple—at
                        least in concept!</p>

                    <p>Think of it like adjusting the bass and treble knobs on a car stereo, but way more precise and
                        powerful. EQ is probably the most important tool in mixing, and once you understand it, you can
                        make almost anything sound better.</p>
                </section>

                <section id="spectrum">
                    <h2>The Frequency Spectrum</h2>
                    <p>Human hearing ranges from about 20 Hz to 20,000 Hz (20 kHz). Different instruments and sounds
                        occupy different parts of this spectrum. Understanding where things live helps you know what to
                        boost or cut.</p>

                    <h3>Sub-Bass (20-60 Hz)</h3>
                    <p>This is the stuff you feel more than hear—the rumble in your chest at a concert. Kick drums, bass
                        synths, and sub-bass live here. Too much and your mix gets muddy; too little and it lacks power.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Bass (60-250 Hz)</h3>
                    <p>The fundamental notes of bass guitars, kick drums, and low toms. This range gives your mix warmth
                        and body. It's also where a lot of muddiness can build up if you're not careful.</p>

                    <h3>Low Mids (250-500 Hz)</h3>
                    <p>This is often called the "mud zone" because too much here makes everything sound boxy and
                        unclear. But you also need some energy here for fullness. It's a delicate balance!</p>

                    <h3>Mids (500 Hz-2 kHz)</h3>
                    <p>Where most instruments live—guitars, vocals, snares. This range is crucial for clarity and
                        presence. Cutting too much makes things sound distant; boosting too much makes them honky or
                        nasal.</p>

                    <h3>Upper Mids (2-4 kHz)</h3>
                    <p>The presence range. Boosting here makes vocals and instruments cut through the mix. Too much gets
                        harsh and fatiguing, though.</p>

                    <h3>Highs (4-8 kHz)</h3>
                    <p>Clarity and definition live here. This is where you hear the pick on a guitar string or the
                        breath in a vocal. Also where sibilance (harsh "S" sounds) hangs out.</p>

                    <h3>Air (8-20 kHz)</h3>
                    <p>The sparkle and shimmer. Cymbals, vocal air, and that sense of space. A little boost here can
                        make things sound more expensive and polished.</p>
                </section>

                <section id="types">
                    <h2>Types of EQ</h2>

                    <h3>Parametric EQ</h3>
                    <p>The most flexible type. You can adjust the frequency, gain (how much you boost/cut), and Q (how
                        wide or narrow the adjustment is). This is what you'll use most in mixing. Every DAW comes with
                        at least one parametric EQ.</p>

                    <h3>Graphic EQ</h3>
                    <p>Has fixed frequency bands with sliders. Less flexible than parametric, but super visual and easy
                        to understand. Great for quick adjustments or live sound.</p>

                    <h3>Shelving EQ</h3>
                    <p>Boosts or cuts everything above (high shelf) or below (low shelf) a certain frequency. Perfect
                        for adding overall brightness or warmth to a track.</p>

                    <h3>High-Pass and Low-Pass Filters</h3>
                    <p>High-pass filters cut everything below a certain frequency (letting the highs "pass through").
                        Low-pass filters do the opposite. These are essential for cleaning up your mix—use a high-pass
                        filter to remove unnecessary low-end rumble from vocals, guitars, etc.</p>
                </section>

                <section id="techniques">
                    <h2>EQ Techniques That Actually Work</h2>

                    <h3>Subtractive EQ First</h3>
                    <p>Here's a pro tip: cut before you boost. It's tempting to boost frequencies to make things sound
                        better, but cutting problem frequencies often works better and sounds more natural. Plus, it
                        leaves you more headroom in your mix.</p>

                    <h3>The Sweep Technique</h3>
                    <p>To find problem frequencies, boost a narrow band (high Q) and sweep through the spectrum. When
                        you find something that sounds bad, cut it instead of boosting. This is super effective for
                        removing harshness or boxiness.</p>

                    <h3>High-Pass Everything (Almost)</h3>
                    <p>Unless it's a kick drum or bass, try putting a high-pass filter on it. Cut everything below
                        80-100 Hz on guitars, vocals, snares, etc. This cleans up your low end and makes room for the
                        instruments that actually need to be there.</p>

                    <h3>Make Space for Each Instrument</h3>
                    <p>If two instruments are fighting for the same frequency range, try cutting one where the other is
                        strong. For example, if your bass and kick are clashing, cut a bit of 60-80 Hz from the bass to
                        make room for the kick.</p>

                    <h3>Use Your Ears, Not Your Eyes</h3>
                    <p>Don't EQ based on what looks good on the screen. Close your eyes and listen. If it sounds better,
                        it is better—even if the curve looks weird.</p>

                <section id="mistakes">
                    <h2>EQ Mistakes to Avoid</h2>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Boosting Too Much:</strong> If you're boosting more than 6 dB, something's probably
                            wrong. Try cutting other frequencies instead.</li>
                        <li><strong>EQing in Solo:</strong> Always check your EQ moves in the context of the full mix.
                            What sounds good solo might not work with everything else.</li>
                        <li><strong>Using Too Narrow Q:</strong> Unless you're surgically removing a problem frequency,
                            use wider Q values for more natural-sounding EQ.</li>
                        <li><strong>Forgetting to A/B:</strong> Always compare your EQ'd sound to the original. Make
                            sure you're actually improving it!</li>
                        <li><strong>EQing to Fix Performance Issues:</strong> EQ can't fix a bad recording or
                            performance. Get it right at the source first.</li>
                    </ul>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
                    <p>EQ is one of those things that's simple in theory but takes years to master. The good news? You
                        don't need to be a master to make your mixes sound way better. Just understanding the
                        basics—knowing what frequencies do what, when to cut vs. boost, and how to use filters—will take
                        you incredibly far.</p>

                    <p>Start simple. High-pass everything that doesn't need low end. Cut problem frequencies before
                        boosting good ones. Use your ears more than your eyes. And most importantly, don't overthink it!
                        If it sounds good, it is good.</p>

                    <p>The best way to learn EQ is just to use it. Experiment, make mistakes, and train your ears. Over
                        time, you'll develop an intuition for what frequencies need adjustment, and EQ will become
                        second nature. So open up your DAW, grab an EQ plugin, and start tweaking. Your mixes will thank
                        you!</p>
