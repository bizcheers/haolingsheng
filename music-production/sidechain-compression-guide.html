                    <h2>The Most Famous "Pump" in Music</h2>
                    <p>Sidechain compression is a mixing technique where the signal level of one track is controlled by
                        the volume of another. It's the secret behind the "pumping" sound in EDM, but it's also a vital
                        tool for clarity in every other genre.</p>

                <section>
                    <h2>The Kick and Bass Battle</h2>
                    <p>The most common use of sidechain is to make room for the kick drum. When the kick drum hits, the
                        sidechain compressor "ducks" (lowers) the volume of the bass for a fraction of a second. This
                        prevents the low-end from becoming a "muddy" mess and makes the kick feel much more punchy.</p>

                    <h2>Creative Uses Beyond the Kick</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Vocal Clarity:</strong> Use the lead vocal to slightly duck the background guitars
                            or synths. This pulls the vocal "forward" in the mix.</li>
                        <li><strong>Reverb Ducking:</strong> Sidechain a heavy reverb to the dry vocal. This keeps the
                            vocal clear while the reverb only fills the "gaps" between words.</li>
                        <li><strong>Extreme Pumping:</strong> In genres like House or Future Bass, you can use extreme
                            sidechain settings to create a rhythmic, lung-like "beat" in the pads and melodies.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>💨 Set Your Release</h3>
                    <p>The **Release** time is the most important setting for sidechain. It should be fast enough that
                        the volume returns to normal before the next beat, creating a musical rhythm that matches your
                        song's BPM.</p>
