                    <h2>The Final 10 Percent</h2>
                    <p>Mastering is the bridge between a finished mix and a commercial release. Its goal is to ensure
                        the song translates well to all playback systems (from iPhones to club PA systems) and reaches
                        the standard loudness levels of the industry.</p>

                    <h2>A Classic Mastering Signal Chain</h2>
                    <p>While every song is unique, most professional mastering chains follow this logical order:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Corrective EQ:</strong> Removing any final "mud" or problematic resonances using a
                            high-precision digital EQ.</li>
                        <li><strong>Glue Compression:</strong> Using a slow-attack, low-ratio compressor (like an SSL
                            Bus Comp) to "tie" the instruments together.</li>
                        <li><strong>Saturation & Excitement:</strong> Adding subtle harmonic richness and high-end
                            "air."</li>
                        <li><strong>Stereo Enhancement:</strong> Ensuring the mix has appropriate width and mono
                            compatibility.</li>
                        <li><strong>Limiting & Metering:</strong> Bringing the track up to commercial volume (LUFS)
                            while ensuring it doesn't "true-peak" clip.</li>
                    </ol>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2>The Importance of Monitoring</h2>
                    <p>Mastering is only as good as the room you hear it in. Always use high-quality, flat-response
                        monitors or headphones, and frequently compare your master to a "reference track" from a
                        professional artist in the same genre.</p>

                <div class="info-card tip">
                    <h3>📏 Aim for -14 to -9 LUFS</h3>
                    <p>Most streaming services (Spotify, Apple Music) normalize tracks to -14 LUFS. However, many modern
                        genres like Pop and Trap are often mastered to -9 or even -7 LUFS for a more aggressive sound.
