                    <h2>What is DistroKid?</h2>
                    <p>DistroKid is a music distribution service that gets your music onto streaming platforms like
                        Spotify, Apple Music, Amazon Music, TikTok, and dozens of others. Instead of needing a record
                        label, you can upload your tracks yourself and start earning royalties from streams and
                        downloads.</p>

                    <p>What makes DistroKid special is its simplicity and pricing model. You pay one annual fee and can
                        upload unlimited songs and albums. No per-release fees, no commission on your royalties—you keep
                        100% of what you earn. For independent artists releasing music regularly, this is a
                        game-changer.</p>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2>DistroKid Pricing (2026)</h2>

                    <h3>Musician ($22.99/year)</h3>
                    <p>The basic plan gets you:</p>

                        <li>Unlimited uploads for one artist name</li>

                        <li>Basic stats and analytics</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>This is perfect if you're just starting out and releasing under one name.</p>

                    <h3>Musician Plus ($39.99/year)</h3>
                    <p>Everything in Musician, plus:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Upload for two artist names</li>
                        <li>Customizable label name</li>

                        <li>Daily stats updates</li>
                        <li>Sync licensing opportunities</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Great if you have multiple projects or want more control over your releases.</p>

                    <h3>Label ($79.99/year)</h3>
                    <p>Everything in Musician Plus, plus:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Unlimited artist names</li>
                        <li>Instant Spotify verification</li>
                        <li>Team accounts (add collaborators)</li>
                        <li>Advanced analytics</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Perfect for producers managing multiple artists or actual small labels.</p>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2>Key Features</h2>

                    <h3>Unlimited Uploads</h3>
                    <p>Unlike competitors who charge per release, DistroKid lets you upload as much as you want.
                        Releasing 50 singles a year? Same price as releasing one. This is huge for prolific artists or
                        beat makers.</p>

                    <h3>Fast Distribution</h3>
                    <p>DistroKid is known for being fast. Your music can go live on streaming platforms in as little as
                        1-2 days, though they recommend uploading at least a week before your release date to be safe.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Keep Your Music Live</h3>
                    <p>As long as you maintain your subscription, your music stays on all platforms. If you cancel,
                        you'll need to pay a "Leave a Legacy" fee ($29 per album/single) to keep specific releases live
                        forever.</p>

                    <h3>Automatic Splits</h3>
                    <p>Collaborating with other artists? DistroKid can automatically split royalties between multiple
                        people. Everyone gets paid directly—no awkward money conversations needed!</p>

                    <h3>YouTube Content ID</h3>
                    <p>For an extra $4.95/year per artist, you can monetize your music on YouTube. When someone uses
                        your song in their video, you earn money from the ads. This is optional but can be worth it if
                        your music gets used a lot.</p>

                    <h3>Instant Verification</h3>
                    <p>With the Label plan, you get instant Spotify verification (the blue checkmark). Otherwise, you'll
                        need to apply through Spotify for Artists separately.</p>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2>How to Use DistroKid</h2>

                    <h3>Step 1: Sign Up</h3>
                    <p>Choose your plan and create an account. You'll need to provide payment info and some basic
                        details about yourself.</p>

                    <h3>Step 2: Upload Your Music</h3>
                    <p>Click "Upload" and fill in the details:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Artist name</li>
                        <li>Album/single title</li>
                        <li>Genre and subgenre</li>
                        <li>Release date</li>
                        <li>Album artwork (3000x3000 pixels minimum)</li>
                        <li>Audio files (WAV or FLAC recommended)</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Step 3: Add Metadata</h3>
                    <p>Fill in songwriter info, producer credits, lyrics, and any other relevant details. The more
                        complete your metadata, the better your music will be represented on streaming platforms.</p>

                    <h3>Step 4: Choose Stores</h3>
                    <p>Select which platforms you want your music on. You can choose all of them or just specific ones.
                        Most artists select everything.</p>

                    <h3>Step 5: Submit</h3>
                    <p>Review everything and hit submit. DistroKid will review your release (usually within 24 hours)
                        and then send it to all the platforms you selected.</p>

                    <h3>Pros</h3>

                        <li><strong>Unlimited uploads:</strong> Perfect for prolific artists</li>
                        <li><strong>Keep 100% of royalties:</strong> No commission taken</li>
                        <li><strong>Fast distribution:</strong> Music goes live quickly</li>

                        <li><strong>Affordable:</strong> Cheaper than most competitors for active artists</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Cons</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Annual subscription:</strong> You have to keep paying to keep music live (unless you
                            pay Leave a Legacy)</li>
                        <li><strong>Extra fees:</strong> Some features like YouTube Content ID cost extra</li>
                        <li><strong>Limited support:</strong> Customer service can be slow</li>
                        <li><strong>No physical distribution:</strong> Digital only—no CDs or vinyl</li>
                        <li><strong>Basic analytics:</strong> Stats are good but not as detailed as some competitors
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2>DistroKid vs. Competitors</h2>

                    <h3>vs. TuneCore</h3>
                    <p>TuneCore charges per release ($29.99 for a single, $49.99 for an album annually). If you release
                        a lot, DistroKid is way cheaper. But TuneCore lets you keep music live even if you stop paying.
                    </p>

                    <h3>vs. CD Baby</h3>
                    <p>CD Baby charges a one-time fee per release ($9.95 for singles, $29 for albums) and takes a 9%
                        commission on royalties. Your music stays live forever, but you earn less per stream. Better for
                        occasional releases; worse for frequent ones.</p>

                    <h3>vs. LANDR</h3>
                    <p>LANDR offers distribution bundled with mastering services. It's more expensive but includes
                        professional mastering. Good if you need both services; overkill if you just need distribution.
                    </p>

                    <h3>vs. Amuse</h3>
                    <p>Amuse has a free tier but limits features and takes a cut of royalties. Their paid tier is
                        comparable to DistroKid but less established. Worth considering if you want to test the waters
                        for free first.</p>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2>Tips for Success</h2>

                    <h3>Upload Early</h3>
                    <p>Submit your music at least 2-3 weeks before your release date. This gives you time to pitch to
                        Spotify playlists and build pre-save campaigns.</p>

                    <h3>Perfect Your Metadata</h3>
                    <p>Make sure all your info is correct—artist name spelling, song titles, credits. Mistakes can delay
                        your release or cause issues with royalty payments.</p>

                    <h3>Use High-Quality Files</h3>
                    <p>Upload WAV or FLAC files, not MP3s. Streaming platforms will convert them, but starting with high
                        quality ensures the best possible sound.</p>

                    <h3>Get Your Artwork Right</h3>
                    <p>Your cover art needs to be at least 3000x3000 pixels, RGB color mode, and follow platform
                        guidelines (no contact info, no misleading text, etc.).</p>

                    <h3>Claim Your Profiles</h3>
                    <p>Once your music is live, claim your artist profiles on Spotify for Artists, Apple Music for
                        Artists, etc. This gives you access to better analytics and promotional tools.</p>

                    <h3>Consider YouTube Content ID</h3>
                    <p>If you think your music might get used in YouTube videos, the $4.95/year for Content ID can pay
                        for itself quickly.</p>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2>Is DistroKid Right for You?</h2>
                    <p>DistroKid is perfect if you're an independent artist who releases music regularly and wants to
                        keep things simple and affordable. The unlimited upload model means you can experiment, release
                        singles frequently, and not worry about per-release costs adding up.</p>

                    <p>It might not be the best choice if you only release music once in a blue moon—in that case, a
                        one-time fee service like CD Baby might make more sense. And if you need physical distribution
                        or white-glove customer service, you might want to look elsewhere.</p>

                    <p>But for most independent artists in 2026? DistroKid is hard to beat. It's affordable, fast, and
                        gets your music everywhere it needs to be. Thousands of successful independent artists use it,
                        and for good reason. If you're serious about releasing music independently, DistroKid is
                        definitely worth considering.</p>
