                    <p>In music, there are two types of copyright: the <strong>Composition</strong> (the words
                        and melody) and the <strong>Sound Recording</strong> (the actual audio file).
                        While PROs like ASCAP and BMI collect for the composition, <strong>Neighboring
                            Rights</strong> (also known as "Related Rights") are royalties paid for the public
                        performance of the sound recording.</p>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2>1. Who Collects Neighboring Rights?</h2>
                    <p>These royalties go to the owners of the sound recording (usually the Label or the
                        independent artist) and the <strong>Performers</strong> on that recording. This
                        includes the featured artist and the session musicians who played in the studio.</p>

                    <h2>2. SoundExchange vs. Neighboring Rights</h2>
                    <p>In the United States, we have <strong>SoundExchange</strong>, which collects
                        performance royalties from <em>digital</em> radio (like Pandora or SiriusXM).
                        However, the US does not pay performers for <em>terrestrial</em> radio (FM/AM).
                        In Europe and most of the rest of the world, terrestrial radio DOES pay
                        performers. This global collection is what is typically called "Neighboring Rights."</p>

                    <h2>3. Why it Matters for Session Musicians</h2>
                    <p>If you are a session musician who played on a hit song that is being played on the
                        radio in the UK, Germany, or Japan, there is money waiting for you. You don't have
                        to own the song to collect these performer royalties.</p>

                <section>
                    <h2>4. How to Collect</h2>
                    <p>To collect these global royalties, you can register with a collection society like
                        <strong>PPL</strong> (UK), <strong>Adami</strong> (France), or use a global
                        administrator like <strong>Songtrust</strong> (for publishing) or dedicated
                        Neighboring Rights agencies.
                    </p>

                <section>
                    <h2>Summary</h2>
                    <p>Neighboring rights are often overlooked by American artists, but they represent
                        a significant portion of global music income. Whether you are a solo artist
                        or a studio player, understanding these "related rights" ensures you are
                        fairly compensated for your performance.</p>
