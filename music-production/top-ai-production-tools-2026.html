                    <h2>3. Soothe 2: Resonance Suppression</h2>
                    <p>While not a "generative" AI, Soothe 2 uses intelligent algorithms to find and kill
                        harsh resonant frequencies in real-time. It's the secret weapon of almost every
                        pro vocal engineer.</p>

                    <p>Ozone's AI Mastering Assistant compares your track to thousands of professional songs

                </section>

                    <h2>Summary</h2>
                    <p>The goal of these tools isn't to replace your creativity, but to remove the
                        technical friction of music production. By using AI to handle the "boring" tasks like
                        cleaning noise or balancing levels, you can spend more time on what matters: the music.</p>
