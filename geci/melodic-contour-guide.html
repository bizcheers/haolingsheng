                <section>
                    <p>Why are some melodies instantly "catchy" while others are forgotten in seconds?
                        The answer often lies in <strong>Melodic Contour</strong>—the visual "shape" the
                        melody makes as it rises and falls in pitch. In this guide, we'll break down the five
                        most common melodic shapes and how they affect the human brain.</p>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2>1. The Arch (The Most Common)</h2>
                    <p>The "Arch" melody starts low, rises to a peak (usually on an important word or emotion),
                        and then falls back down. This shape feels natural, complete, and fulfilling. Thousands
                        of pop and folk songs use this because it mimics the natural arc of a spoken sentence.</p>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2>2. The Inverted Arch (The Valley)</h2>
                    <p>The opposite of an arch—starting high, dipping low, and ending high again. This can
                        create a sense of "diving" into an emotion or a brief moment of intimacy before
                        returning to strength.</p>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2>3. The Ascending Staircase</h2>
                    <p>These melodies keep moving upward. This is a classic tool for building <strong>Tension</strong>.
                        As the pitch gets higher, our ears perceive it as a "reaching" toward a goal, making the
                        listener wait for a resolution.</p>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2>4. The Descending Line</h2>
                    <p>Melodies that fall gradually often evoke sadness, resignation, or peacefulness. Think
                        of a sigh—it starts with high energy and releases it downward.</p>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2>5. Stationary / Oscillating</h2>
                    <p>Some melodies stay on one or two notes for a long time. This creates a sense of
                        stasis, boredom, or intensity (like a heartbeat). It can be used effectively to
                        build anticipation for a more complex melody in the next section.</p>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2>Summary</h2>
                    <p>A great melody is like a landscape—it needs hills, valleys, and horizons. By being
                        intentional about your melodic contour, you ensure your music has a visual
                        logic that the listener's brain can effortlessly follow.</p>

                    <h4>The "Draw It" Trick</h4>
                    <p>Try drawing a simple line graph of your melody on a piece of paper. If the line is
                        a flat horizontal line for too long, your melody probably lacks interest.</p>
