                    <p>When you listen to a professional Top 40 record, it sounds like the music is wrapping around your
                        head. The vocals are right in front of you, the guitars are wide to the sides, and the reverb
                        feels like it is coming from way back in the room. This is the result of <strong>Stereo
                            Imaging</strong>.</p>
                    <p>A "flat" mix happens when everything is fighting for the center. A "pro" mix uses the entire
                        stereo field. In this guide, we will explore the technical and creative ways to add width and
                        depth to your music without losing power.</p>
                </section>

                <section id="panning">
                    <h2>1. The Rule of Panning (L-C-R)</h2>
                    <p>The most basic tool for stereo imaging is the <strong>Pan Pot</strong>. Many professional
                        engineers follow the <strong>L-C-R Technique</strong>: they only place instruments either 100%
                        Left, 100% Right, or dead Center.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>The Center (Mono):</strong> Reserved for the most important, energy-heavy elements:
                            Lead Vocals, Kick Drum, Snare Drum, and Bass.</li>
                        <li><strong>The Sides:</strong> Rhythmic guitars, piano overdubs, percussion, and backing
                            vocals.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>By keeping the center clear for the "big players," you provide a solid foundation. If everything
                        is panned 50% left or right, the mix starts to feel "blurry."</p>
                </section>

                <section id="haas">
                    <h2>2. The Haas Effect (Precedence Effect)</h2>
                    <p>The <strong>Haas Effect</strong> is a psychoacoustic trick. If you take a mono sound, duplicate
                        it, pan one copy hard left and the other hard right, and then delay one side by about 10ms -
                        30ms, your brain perceives it as a single, incredibly wide sound.</p>
                    <p><strong>Warning:</strong> Use this carefully! While it sounds great in headphones, it can cause
                        <strong>Phase Cancellation</strong>. If you listen in mono (like on a phone speaker), the
                        instrument might disappear completely.</p>
                </section>

                <section id="mid-side">
                    <h2>3. Mid-Side (M/S) Processing</h2>
                    <p>This is an advanced technique where you split the stereo signal into two parts:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Mid:</strong> Everything that is identical in both speakers (the center).</li>
                        <li><strong>Side:</strong> Everything that is different (the width).</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Using an M/S EQ, you can boost the high frequencies on just the <strong>Side</strong> channel to
                        add "sparkle" and "air" to the edges of your mix without making the lead vocal too bright. This
                        is a secret of professional mastering engineers.</p>
                </section>

                <section id="doubling">
                    <h2>4. Doubling and Layering</h2>
                    <p>The best way to get wide guitars or vocals isn't a plugin—it's <strong>performing the part
                            twice</strong>. Record two separate takes of your rhythm guitar, pan one hard left and one
                        hard right. Because the two takes have tiny differences in timing and pitch, they create a
                        natural, massive stereo image that no plugin can perfectly replicate.</p>
                </section>

                <section id="mono-compatibility">
                    <h2>5. The Importance of Mono Compatibility</h2>
                    <p>In 2026, many people still listen to music on mono devices: Bluetooth speakers, Instagram Reels,
                        or club sound systems. <strong>Always check your mix in mono.</strong></p>
                    <p>If your mix sounds "thin" or "hollow" when you hit the mono button, you have a phase issue. This
                        usually means you have used too many "stereo widener" plugins or too much Haas effect. Use a
                        <strong>Correlation Meter</strong>; it should stay between 0 and +1. If it goes into the red
                        (-1), you have a problem.</p>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2>Summary: Building the 3D Box</h2>
                    <p>Stereo imaging is about contrast. You can't have "wide" without having "narrow." By keeping your
                        foundation rock-solid in the center and using surgical panning and Mid-Side processing for your
                        decorative elements, you can create a mix that feels expansive, immersive, and professional.</p>

                    <h4>Pro Tip: Mono the Bass</h4>
                    <p>Always keep everything below 150Hz in <strong>Mono</strong>. Panning your bass or kick drum will
                        make the mix feel unstable and "lop-sided" on large club systems.</p>

                    <h4>Micro-Panning</h4>
                    <p>Try panning your hi-hats slightly to one side and your percussion slightly to the other. This
                        creates a "rhythmic width" that keeps the listener engaged.</p>
