                    <h2>The Foundation of the Groove</h2>
                    <p>Drum programming is the backbone of modern music production. Whether you're making Lo-fi, Techno,
                        or Pop, your drums need to do more than just "keep time"—they need to feel alive, rhythmic, and
                        dynamic.</p>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2>The "Robot" Problem: Why Your Drums Sound Stiff</h2>
                    <p>If every drum hit is perfectly on the grid and at 100% volume (velocity), your drums will sound
                        like a machine. To fix this, use these three techniques:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Velocity Variation:</strong> No drummer hits the snare with the exact same force
                            twice. Vary your MIDI velocity by 10-20% for a natural feel.</li>
                        <li><strong>Ghost Notes:</strong> Add very soft (low velocity) snare or hi-hat hits between the
                            main beats. This creates "groove" and fills the silence with rhythm.</li>
                        <li><strong>Swing and Offset:</strong> Move your hi-hats or claps slightly *late* (a few
                            milliseconds) to create a relaxed, "behind the beat" feel.</li>
                    </ul>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2>Sound Selection: Samples matter</h2>
                    <p>Professional drum programming starts with the right samples. A "weak" kick drum can't be fixed by
                        EQ; it must be replaced. Spend time finding samples that already sound 90% like the finished
                        record before you even start programming.</p>
                </section>

                <div class="info-card tip">
                    <h3>🥁 The 2 and 4</h3>
                    <p>For a classic "backbeat," keep your snare hits on the 2 and 4 consistent in velocity. This
                        provides a steady anchor that allows the rest of your rhythms to be more experimental.</p>

                <section>
                    <h2>Humanizing Your Beats</h2>
                    <p>Drum programming is about more than just placing notes on a grid. Learn how to use velocity,
                        slight timing offsets, and swing to make your MIDI drums feel alive and grooving.</p>
