                    <h2>The Magic of Stem Extraction</h2>
                    <p>AI audio separation, also known as source separation, has revolutionized the workflow for
                        remixers, educators, and sample-based producers. By using deep learning models trained on
                        millions of multi-track recordings, these tools can isolate specific elements from a stereo mix
                        with surgical precision.</p>

                    <h2>Top Tools for High-Fidelity Separation</h2>
                    <p>Not all separation tools are created equal. Depending on your technical needs, some offer better
                        clarity than others:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>LALAL.AI:</strong> Best for ease of use and web-based processing. Its Orion engine
                            is particularly strong for vocal extraction.</li>
                        <li><strong>Ultimate Vocal Remover (UVR5):</strong> The industry standard for professional
                            clean-up. It's a free, open-source desktop app that allows you to choose from various MDX
                            and Demucs models.</li>
                        <li><strong>RipX DAW:</strong> Unique in that it treats audio as MIDI-like objects, allowing for
                            pitch editing after separation.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>The "Spectral Leakage" Challenge</h2>
                    <p>No AI separation is perfect. You will often encounter "artifacts"—ghostly echoes of the drums in
                        the vocal track, for example. To minimize this, always process high-quality lossless files
                        (WAV/FLAC) rather than MP3s.</p>

                    <h3>🛠️ Common Use Case: Karaoke Tracks</h3>
                    <p>The fastest way to create a high-quality backing track is to isolate the "Instrumental" stem. For
                        best results, use a model specifically trained for "Vocals vs. Rest" separation.</p>
