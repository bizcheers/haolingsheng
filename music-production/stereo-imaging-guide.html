                    <h2>Creating a 3D Mix</h2>
                    <p>Stereo imaging is the art of placing sounds within the horizontal (left-to-right) and depth
                        (front-to-back) planes of a mix. A mix with poor imaging sounds "cluttered" and "small," while a
                        great image feels wide, immersive, and detailed.</p>

                <section>
                    <h2>The Foundation: L-C-R Panning</h2>
                    <p>One of the most powerful imaging techniques is the "L-C-R" method. This involves placing elements
                        only and exclusively in the **Left (100%)**, **Center (0%)**, or **Right (100%)** positions.
                        This creates a massive sense of width by leaving the "in-between" spaces completely clear for
                        effects and detail.</p>

                <section>
                    <h2>Advanced Imaging Tools</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Mid-Side EQ:</strong> Boost the high frequencies on the "Sides" (the signal that is
                            different between L and R) to make a sound feel wider without affecting its center punch.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>The Haas Effect:</strong> Delay one side of a signal by 15-30 milliseconds. The
                            brain perceives this as a single, ultra-wide sound source.</li>
                        <li><strong>Stereo Widening Plugins:</strong> Tools like the Ozone Imager or Polyverse Comet can
                            artificially create width by manipulating the phase of the signal.</li>
                    </ul>
                </section>

                    <h3>⚠️ Phase Correlation</h3>
                    <p>Always check your mix in **Mono**. If your stereo-widened tracks disappear or sound "hollow" when
                        summed to mono, you have phase cancellation issues. Use a correlation meter to ensure your width
                        isn't breaking your mix's integrity.</p>
