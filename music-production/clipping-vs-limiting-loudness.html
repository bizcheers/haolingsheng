                    <h2>Loudness Without Distorting</h2>
                    <p>In the modern "Loudness War," getting a mix to sound competitive at -7 or -8 LUFS requires more
                        than just a limiter. You must manage your "transients" (peaks) at every stage of the mix, and
                        that's where the comparison between Clipping and Limiting begins.</p>

                    <h2>Limiting: The Traditional Ceiling</h2>
                    <p>A Limiter is essentially a compressor with an infinite ratio. It prevents audio from going above
                        0dB by "squashing" the peaks. While effective, pushing a limiter too hard causes "pumping" and a
                        loss of punch because it affects the whole waveform.</p>

                    <h2>Clipping: The Professional Secret</h2>
                    <p>A **Soft Clipper** doesn't compress the waveform; it simply "chops off" the very top of the
                        peaks. Surprisingly, this often sounds *more transparent* than limiting for aggressive genres
                        like EDM, Trap, and Rock. By clipping your drum bus or individual tracks, you allow the final
                        limiter to work much more efficiently, leading to a louder and cleaner master.</p>

                    <h3>🧊 Digital vs Analog Clipping</h3>
                    <p>**Digital Clipping** is harsh and ugly. **Soft Clipping** (using a dedicated plugin) emulates the
                        saturation of analog tape or tubes, turning those peaks into pleasant-sounding harmonics rather
                        than crackling noise.</p>

                    <p>Discover how professional engineers use soft clipping to shave off peaks before the limiter,
                        allowing for much louder masters with less audible distortion.</p>
