                    <h2>What is a Major Scale?</h2>
                    <p>A major scale is one of the most fundamental concepts in music theory. It's a seven-note scale
                        that follows a specific pattern of whole steps and half steps, creating the bright, happy sound
                        we associate with major keys. Understanding major scales is essential for any musician, as they
                        form the foundation for melody, harmony, and musical composition.</p>

                    <p>The major scale is also known as the Ionian mode and serves as the basis for Western music
                        theory. When you hear someone say a song is "in C major" or "in G major," they're referring to
                        the major scale built on that particular note.</p>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2>The Major Scale Pattern</h2>
                    <p>The magic of the major scale lies in its consistent pattern. No matter which note you start on,
                        the major scale always follows the same sequence of intervals:</p>

                    <p><strong>Whole - Whole - Half - Whole - Whole - Whole - Half</strong></p>

                    <p>This pattern is often abbreviated as <strong>W-W-H-W-W-W-H</strong>, where W represents a whole
                        step (two semitones) and H represents a half step (one semitone).</p>

                    <h3>Understanding Steps</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Half Step:</strong> The smallest distance between two notes in Western music. On a
                            piano, it's the distance from one key to the very next key (including black keys).</li>
                        <li><strong>Whole Step:</strong> Equal to two half steps. On a piano, it's like skipping one
                            key between notes.</li>
                    </ul>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2>Building a Major Scale</h2>
                    <p>Let's build a C major scale step by step to see how this pattern works in practice:</p>

                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Start with C</strong> (the root note)</li>
                        <li><strong>Whole step up:</strong> C to D</li>
                        <li><strong>Whole step up:</strong> D to E</li>
                        <li><strong>Half step up:</strong> E to F</li>
                        <li><strong>Whole step up:</strong> F to G</li>
                        <li><strong>Whole step up:</strong> G to A</li>
                        <li><strong>Whole step up:</strong> A to B</li>
                        <li><strong>Half step up:</strong> B to C (back to the starting note, one octave higher)</li>
                    </ol>

                    <p>The resulting C major scale is: <strong>C - D - E - F - G - A - B - C</strong></p>

                    <p>Notice that C major uses only the white keys on a piano, which is why it's often the first scale
                        beginners learn. However, the same W-W-H-W-W-W-H pattern applies to major scales starting on any
                        note.</p>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2>Scale Degrees and Their Names</h2>
                    <p>Each note in a major scale has a specific function and name based on its position:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>1st degree - Tonic:</strong> The home note, the most stable and important</li>
                        <li><strong>2nd degree - Supertonic:</strong> One step above the tonic</li>
                        <li><strong>3rd degree - Mediant:</strong> Midway between tonic and dominant</li>
                        <li><strong>4th degree - Subdominant:</strong> Below the dominant in importance</li>
                        <li><strong>5th degree - Dominant:</strong> Second most important note, creates tension</li>
                        <li><strong>6th degree - Submediant:</strong> Midway between subdominant and tonic</li>
                        <li><strong>7th degree - Leading Tone:</strong> Leads strongly back to the tonic</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Understanding these scale degrees helps you comprehend how melodies and harmonies function within
                        a key.</p>

                    <h2>Common Major Scales</h2>

                    <h3>C Major Scale</h3>
                    <p><strong>Notes:</strong> C - D - E - F - G - A - B - C</p>
                    <p><strong>Key Signature:</strong> No sharps or flats</p>
                    <p><strong>Why it's important:</strong> The simplest major scale, uses only white keys on piano</p>

                    <h3>G Major Scale</h3>
                    <p><strong>Notes:</strong> G - A - B - C - D - E - F# - G</p>
                    <p><strong>Key Signature:</strong> One sharp (F#)</p>
                    <p><strong>Pattern applied:</strong> Starting from G, following W-W-H-W-W-W-H requires F# instead
                        of F natural</p>

                    <h3>D Major Scale</h3>
                    <p><strong>Notes:</strong> D - E - F# - G - A - B - C# - D</p>
                    <p><strong>Key Signature:</strong> Two sharps (F#, C#)</p>
                    <p><strong>Common usage:</strong> Popular in orchestral and string music</p>

                    <h3>F Major Scale</h3>
                    <p><strong>Notes:</strong> F - G - A - Bb - C - D - E - F</p>
                    <p><strong>Key Signature:</strong> One flat (Bb)</p>
                    <p><strong>Pattern applied:</strong> The fourth note needs to be Bb to maintain the major scale
                        pattern</p>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2>Key Signatures and the Circle of Fifths</h2>
                    <p>Key signatures tell you which notes are sharp or flat in a particular key. They're directly
                        related to major scales:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Sharp Keys:</strong> G, D, A, E, B, F#, C# (each adds one more sharp)</li>
                        <li><strong>Flat Keys:</strong> F, Bb, Eb, Ab, Db, Gb, Cb (each adds one more flat)</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>The Circle of Fifths is a visual tool that shows the relationship between different major scales.
                        Moving clockwise adds sharps, while moving counterclockwise adds flats. Each step represents a
                        perfect fifth interval.</p>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2>Practical Applications</h2>

                    <h3>For Melody Writing</h3>
                    <p>Major scales provide the notes you can use to create melodies in a given key. Staying within the
                        scale creates a cohesive, harmonious sound, while occasionally stepping outside can add color
                        and interest.</p>

                    <h3>For Harmony and Chords</h3>
                    <p>Chords are built by stacking notes from the major scale in thirds. The major scale determines
                        which chords are major, minor, or diminished in a key:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>I, IV, V chords are major</li>
                        <li>ii, iii, vi chords are minor</li>
                        <li>vii° chord is diminished</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>For Improvisation</h3>
                    <p>Knowing your major scales is essential for improvisation. Jazz, blues, and rock musicians use
                        major scales (and their variations) as the foundation for creating solos and melodic lines.</p>

                    <h2>Practice Tips</h2>

                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Start with C Major:</strong> Learn the pattern using only white keys before adding
                            sharps and flats</li>
                        <li><strong>Practice in All Keys:</strong> Work through all 12 major scales to build complete
                            understanding</li>
                        <li><strong>Use a Metronome:</strong> Practice scales slowly and evenly, gradually increasing
                            tempo</li>
                        <li><strong>Play in Different Octaves:</strong> Expand your range and finger dexterity</li>
                        <li><strong>Sing While Playing:</strong> Develop your ear by matching pitch with your voice</li>
                        <li><strong>Practice Ascending and Descending:</strong> Master both directions equally</li>
                        <li><strong>Apply to Music:</strong> Identify major scales in songs you're learning</li>
                    </ol>

                    <h2>Common Mistakes to Avoid</h2>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Forgetting the Pattern:</strong> Always remember W-W-H-W-W-W-H, regardless of
                            starting note</li>
                        <li><strong>Incorrect Fingering:</strong> Use proper fingering from the start to build good
                            technique</li>
                        <li><strong>Rushing:</strong> Speed comes with accuracy; practice slowly first</li>
                        <li><strong>Ignoring Key Signatures:</strong> Pay attention to which notes are sharp or flat in
                            each key</li>
                        <li><strong>Not Listening:</strong> Always listen to ensure you're playing the correct intervals
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2>Wrapping Up</h2>
                    <p>So there you have it—the major scale in all its glory! Once you get that W-W-H-W-W-W-H pattern
                        down, you've got the key to understanding so much of Western music. It's like learning the
                        alphabet before you can read—major scales are that fundamental.</p>

                    <p>Don't stress about memorizing everything at once. Start with C major (it's the easiest), get
                        comfortable with it, then gradually work your way through the other keys. Before you know it,
                        you'll be playing scales without even thinking about the pattern. Your fingers will just know
                        where to go, and your ears will tell you when something sounds right.</p>

                    <p>The cool thing is, once you really understand major scales, everything else in music theory
                        starts making way more sense. Chords? They come from scales. Melodies? Built on scales.
                        Improvisation? You guessed it—scales are your foundation. So yeah, they're worth the practice
                        time!</p>
