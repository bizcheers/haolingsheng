                <section>
                    <p>A great song isn't just a collection of cool sounds—it's a journey. To keep a listener
                        engaged, a song must have <strong>structure</strong>. In this guide, we'll break down
                        the common "building blocks" of a modern song and explain how to arrange them for
                        maximum emotional impact.</p>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2>1. The Verse: The Storyteller</h2>
                    <p>The verse is where the narrative lives. It sets the scene, introduces the characters,
                        and provides context. Musically, verses are usually lower in intensity and energy
                        compared to the chorus, allowing the story to be heard clearly.</p>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2>2. The Chorus: The Emotional Core</h2>
                    <p>The chorus (or "Refrain") is the heart of the song. It contains the <strong>Hook</strong>—the
                        most memorable melody line. Lyrically, the chorus summarizes the main theme or
                        emotion of the song. It is where the energy is highest and the arrangement is
                        usually at its fullest.</p>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2>3. The Pre-Chorus: The Builder</h2>
                    <p>The pre-chorus acts as a bridge between the verse and the chorus. Its primary job is to
                        increase tension and "lift" the listener into the explosive energy of the chorus. It
                        often uses climbing melodies or intensifying rhythms.</p>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2>4. The Bridge: The Departure</h2>
                    <p>About two-thirds of the way through a song, the listener needs a break. The bridge
                        provides <strong>contrast</strong>. It usually features a new chord progression, a
                        different melody, and a shift in lyrical perspective. It’s the "plot twist" before
                        the final big chorus.</p>

                        role of each section, you can guide your listener through an emotional experience that
                        is both familiar and exciting.</p>

                    <h4>Pro Tip</h4>
                    <p>If your transition from verse to chorus feels weak, try a "stop" or a "gap"—remove
                        all instruments for the final half-measure of the verse. The silence will make the
                        entry of the chorus feel massive.</p>
