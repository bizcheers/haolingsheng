                    <p>No matter how good a singer is, they rarely get the "perfect" take from start to finish.
                        Modern pop and rock vocals are constructed through a process called <strong>vocal
                            comping</strong>
                        (short for composite take). In this guide, we'll show you how to sift through hours of
                        recordings to assemble a lead vocal that sounds natural, emotional, and flawless.</p>

                    <h2>1. What is Vocal Comping?</h2>
                    <p>Vocal comping is the process of taking the best phrases, words, or even syllables from
                        multiple vocal recordings and combining them into one single, master track. The goal is
                        to create a performance that captures the best tone, pitch, and emotion of every section.</p>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2>2. The Recording Strategy</h2>
                    <p>You can't comp effectively if you haven't recorded enough material. We recommend at least
                        <strong>5 to 10 full takes</strong> of the lead vocal. Don't stop when you "think" you
                        have it; sometimes the best emotion comes in a "safety take" when the singer is more
                        relaxed.
                    </p>

                    <div class="info-card">
                        <h4>Step-by-Step Selection:</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Emotional First:</strong> Choose the take that FEELS the best, even if it has
                                minor pitch flaws. We can fix pitch, but we can't fake soul.</li>
                            <li><strong>Section by Section:</strong> Don't try to pick the best "whole take." Pick the
                                best Verse 1, then the best Chorus, etc.</li>
                            <li><strong>Use Your DAW's Tools:</strong> Features like Logic's "Quick Swipe Comping" or
                                Pro Tools "Playlists" are designed specifically for this.</li>
                        </ul>

                    <h2>4. Seamless Editing: The Crossfade</h2>
                    <p>The secret to a comp that doesn't sound "chopped" is the <strong>crossfade</strong>.
                        Always edit at a zero-crossing point and use short, subtle fades (2-5ms) between sections.
                        Listen for breath consistency; never cut in the middle of a breath unless you're replacing
                        it entirely.</p>
                </section>

                    <h2>Summary</h2>
                    <p>Vocal comping is a test of patience. It's the technical groundwork that allows a singer's
                        talent to shine. By masterfully assembling the best moments, you ensure your listener
                        hears nothing but the most powerful version of the song.</p>

                    <p>Keep a "rejects" track. Sometimes a take that didn't work for the lead is perfect for an
