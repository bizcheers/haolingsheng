                    <p>In the age of bedroom pop, some of the world's biggest hits are recorded in closets and
                        spare bedrooms. But how do you get that "expensive" studio sound without a $500-an-hour
                        facility? In this guide, we break down the essentials of <strong>recording vocals at
                            home</strong>
                        to help you capture broadcast-ready takes every time.</p>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2>1. Master Your Environment</h2>
                    <p>Your room's acoustics matter more than your microphone. A $10,000 mic in a boxy, resonant
                        room will sound amateur. A $100 mic in a well-treated space will sound like a hit.</p>
                    <div class="info-card">
                        <h4>Budget Treatment Hacks:</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>The Closet Trick:</strong> Heavy coats and clothing are excellent natural
                                absorbers. Recording inside a walk-in closet is a classic "pro" move.</li>
                            <li><strong>Duvet/Blanket Fort:</strong> Hang a thick moving blanket or duvet behind the
                                singer to catch reflections from the wall.</li>
                            <li><strong>The Pillow Method:</strong> Place pillows in the corners of the room to act as
                                temporary bass traps.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2>2. Microphone Choice & Placement</h2>
                    <p>For home recording, you generally have two choices:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Condenser Mics (e.g., Rode NT1):</strong> Very sensitive, captures detail. Best for
                            breathy pop or intimate vocals.</li>
                        <li><strong>Dynamic Mics (e.g., Shure SM7B):</strong> Less sensitive but handles loud vocals
                            beautifully. Best for rock, rap, or noisy rooms.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Placement:</strong> Aim for 6-10 inches away from the mic. Use a <strong>pop
                            filter</strong>
                        to stop "Ps" and "Bs" from clipping the signal.</p>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2>3. Gain Staging & Levels</h2>
                    <p>Never record into the "red." Your levels should peak around <strong>-12dB to -6dB</strong>.
                        This leaves plenty of "headroom" for mixing and ensures you don't accidentally clip and
                        ruin a perfect performance.</p>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2>4. Psychological Comfort</h2>
                    <p>Singing is 90% confidence. Dim the lights, have water ready, and make sure the singer can
                        hear themselves perfectly in the headphones with just a touch of reverb to help them stay
                        on pitch.</p>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2>Summary</h2>
                    <p>Capturing great vocals at home is about removing distractions and managing your space.
                        By focusing on room treatment, correct mic technique, and a comfortable vibe, you can
                        achieve results that rival the world's best studios.</p>
