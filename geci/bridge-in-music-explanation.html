                    <p>You've heard the Verse. You've sang along to the Chorus twice. Suddenly, the song takes a
                        detour—new chords, a new melody, and a different energy. That's the <strong>Bridge</strong>.
                        But <em>what is a bridge in music</em> beyond just being a detour? In this guide, we explore
                        the structural power of the bridge and how to write one that elevates your track.</p>

                    <h2>1. The Role of the Bridge: Contrast and Resolution</h2>
                    <p>The primary job of a bridge is to provide <strong>contrast</strong>. By the time the listener
                        has heard Verse 1, Chorus, Verse 2, and Chorus, the ear can become fatigued. The bridge
                        refreshes the listener's interest before the final explosive chorus.</p>

                    <h2>2. Common Features of a Bridge</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>New Chords:</strong> Often moves to the "subdominant" (IV chord) or a relative
                            minor.</li>
                        <li><strong>Melodic Shift:</strong> Often uses higher notes or a different rhythmic pace.</li>
                        <li><strong>Lyrical "Pivot":</strong> A bridge often reveals a new perspective or a "twist" in
                            the song's story.</li>

                    <h2>Summary</h2>
                    <p>Don't treat the bridge as an afterthought. It is the bridge that connects the repetitive
                        sections of your song to a satisfying, high-energy conclusion. Master the bridge, and you
                        master the song.</p>
