                    <h2>The Missing Money</h2>
                    <p>Many independent artists believe that once they've uploaded their music to <a
                            href="distrokid-complete-guide.html">DistroKid</a> or another distributor, they're
                        collecting all their earnings. <strong>This is a common misconception.</strong> While
                        distributors collect your recording royalties (master royalties), they do <em>not</em> collect
                        your publishing royalties. If you haven't set up a publishing administrator like Songtrust, you
                        are likely leaving up to 50% of your earnings on the table.</p>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2>Recording vs. Publishing</h2>
                    <p>Every song has two copyrights:
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>The Master:</strong> The specific recording of the song. (Collected by your
                            distributor).</li>
                        <li><strong>The Composition:</strong> The underlying melody, lyrics, and structure. (This is
                            what "publishing" is all about).</li>
                    </ol>
                    Even if you're a one-person band who writes and records everything, you are both the performer and
                    the songwriter. You deserve to be paid for both.</p>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2>What Does Songtrust Do?</h2>
                    <p>Songtrust is a global publishing administrator. They don't own your rights; they just do the
                        paperwork to collect your money from societies all over the world.
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Performance Royalties:</strong> Generated when your song is played on the radio, in
                            a venue, or streamed on Spotify. (Partially collected by PROs like BMI or ASCAP).</li>
                        <li><strong>Mechanical Royalties:</strong> Generated whenever a song is "reproduced"—every time
                            someone hits play on a streaming service. PROs do <em>not</em> collect these.</li>
                    </ul>
                    Songtrust registers your songs with over 50 collection societies globally to make sure every cent
                    finds its way back to you.</p>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2>PROs (BMI/ASCAP) vs. Songtrust</h2>
                    <p>A Performance Rights Organization (PRO) only collects <em>performance</em> royalties. In the US,
                        they don't collect mechanical royalties. This means if your song is streamed in Europe, a US PRO
                        might struggle to get the mechanical portion of that revenue back to you. Songtrust bridge this
                        gap by acting as your global publishing representative.</p>

                <section>
                    <h2>How to Set Up Properly</h2>
                    <p>To ensure you're collecting 100% of your <a href="how-to-make-money-from-music.html">music
                            monetization</a> potential, follow this checklist:
                    <ol>
                        <li>Sign up with a distributor (like <a href="distrokid-complete-guide.html">DistroKid</a>) for
                            your master royalties.</li>
                        <li>Sign up with a PRO (BMI, ASCAP, PRS, etc.) as a songwriter.</li>
                        <li>Sign up with Songtrust and link your PRO account.</li>
                        <li>Register every song on both your distributor and Songtrust.</li>
                    </ol>
                    </p>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2>Is It Worth the Cost?</h2>
                    <p>Songtrust usually charges a one-time registration fee and takes a small percentage (around 15%)
                        of the royalties they collect. If you only have a few hundred streams, it might take a while to
                        earn back the fee. However, if your music is getting global traction, the "black box" royalties
                        (money that is sitting unclaimed) can add up to thousands of dollars very quickly.</p>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
                    <p>Treat your music like a business. If you're serious about your career, you need to understand
                        where your money is coming from. Don't let your publishing royalties vanish into the "black box"
                        of unclaimed revenue. Set up your publishing administration early, and focus on what you do
                        best: making great music. You've earned it!</p>
