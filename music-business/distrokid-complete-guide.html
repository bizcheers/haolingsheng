                <section title="Introduction">
                    <h2>The Industry Standard?</h2>
                    <p>If you ask any independent artist where they distribute their music, 70% will say
                        <strong>DistroKid</strong>. It has become the default choice for modern musicians, especially in
                        the hip-hop and electronic scenes. But is it actually the best? Or just the most famous?</p>
                    <p>In this comprehensive guide, we will break down everything you need to know about DistroKid fees,
                        hidden costs, and how it compares to the competition.</p>
                </section>

                <section id="basics">
                    <h2>The Core Promise: Unlimited Uploads</h2>
                    <p>The main selling point of DistroKid is the "Unlimited" model. Unlike CD Baby or TuneCore (classic
                        model), which charged you every time you released a single, DistroKid charges you one annual
                        fee.</p>
                    <p>For <strong>$22.99/year</strong>, you can release 1 song or 100 songs. If you are a prolific
                        artist releasing a single every month, this saves you hundreds of dollars compared to
                        pay-per-release distributors.</p>
                </section>

                <section id="pricing">
                    <h2>Pricing Tiers Explained</h2>
                    <p>DistroKid offers three main tiers. Choosing the wrong one can be a headache later.</p>

                    <h3>1. Musician ($22.99/year)</h3>
                    <p><strong>Verdict:</strong> Avoid if possible.</p>
                    <p>While cheap, this plan has a major flaw: <strong>You cannot release on a specific future
                            date.</strong> Your music goes live "whenever it's ready." This means you cannot pitch to
                        Spotify Playlists properly, because playlist pitching requires a scheduled release date at least
                        2 weeks in advance.</p>

                    <h3>2. Musician Plus ($39.99/year) - Recommended</h3>
                    <p><strong>Verdict:</strong> The Standard.</p>
                    <p>This plan unlocks <strong>Scheduled Release Dates</strong>. This is non-negotiable for serious
                        artists. It also lets you customize your "Label Name" (so it doesn't say "DistroKid.com" in the
                        credits) and gives you daily stats.</p>

                    <h3>3. Label ($79.99/year)</h3>
                    <p><strong>Verdict:</strong> Only for teams.</p>
                    <p>This allows you to manage 5 to 100 different artists from one account. Great for producers or
                        collectives.</p>
                </section>

                <section id="hidden-fees">
                    <h2>⚠️ The "Hidden" Fees (The Catch)</h2>
                    <p>DistroKid is cheap upfront, but they make their money on the "Extras." You need to be careful
                        during the upload process, or you will accidentally spend more than you planned.</p>

                    <div class="info-card note">
                        <h3>YouTube Content ID ($4.95/year + 20% cut)</h3>
                        <p>If you want to get paid when other people use your song on YouTube, you must check this box.
                            It costs $4.95 <em>per single</em>, every year. This adds up fast if you have a large
                            catalog.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="info-card note">
                        <h3>Store Maximizer ($7.95/year)</h3>
                        <p>DistroKid claims this will automatically add your song to "new stores" that launch in the
                            future. In reality, most new stores are tiny and generate $0.00 revenue. You usually do not
                            need this.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="info-card note">
                        <h3>Leave a Legacy ($29.00/single)</h3>
                        <p>If you stop paying your annual $22.99 fee, DistroKid will remove your music from Spotify. To
                            prevent this, you can pay a one-time $29 fee per song to keep it up forever. This is
                            expensive but provides peace of mind.</p>
                    </div>
                </section>

                <section id="royalties">
                    <h2>Royalties & Payouts</h2>
                    <p>DistroKid pays out 100% of your royalties (minus taxes and banking fees). They do not take a
                        percentage cut (unless you use the Splits feature, which is free).</p>
                    <p>However, getting paid requires understanding <a href="music-copyright-essentials.html">Music
                            Copyright Essentials</a>. You need to fill out your W8-BEN tax form correctly, or the US
                        government may withhold 30% of your earnings. DistroKid uses a service called Tipalti to process
                        payments, which is secure but can have high transaction fees for international wire transfers.
                    </p>
                </section>

                <section id="covers">
                    <h2>Distributing Cover Songs</h2>
                    <p>One of DistroKid's best features is its automated cover song licensing. If you cover a song by
                        Taylor Swift, you legally need a mechanical license to sell it.</p>
                    <p>DistroKid charges <strong>$12/year per cover song</strong>. They handle paying the original
                        songwriter their share efficiently. This is much easier than obtaining a license manually
                        through Harry Fox Agency.</p>
                </section>

                <section id="strategy">
                    <h2>Verification Strategy</h2>
                    <p>Before you release, you should claim your artist profiles. DistroKid helps with this. Once your
                        first song is delivered, you can use the DistroKid URI to claim your profile on <a
                            href="spotify-for-artists-complete-guide.html">Spotify for Artists</a>. This is crucial for
                        customizing your bio and seeing real-time stats.</p>
                </section>

                <section id="verdict">
                    <h2>Final Verdict</h2>
                    <p><strong>Is DistroKid right for you?</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>YES</strong> if you release music frequently (hip-hop, electronic, pop).</li>
                        <li><strong>YES</strong> if you collaborate often (their "Teams" split feature is the best in
                            the industry).</li>
                        <li><strong>NO</strong> if you only release one album every 5 years (CD Baby is cheaper
                            long-term).</li>
                        <li><strong>NO</strong> if you are an audiophile jazz ensemble (traditional distributors offer
                            more white-glove service).</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>For 90% of producers reading this site, DistroKid is the tool that powers the modern music
                        economy. Just watch out for those checkboxes at checkout.</p>
