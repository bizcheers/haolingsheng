                    <h2>The Infinite Patch Cable</h2>
                    <p>Modular synthesis is a method of sound synthesis where the different blocks (oscillators,
                        filters, amplifiers) are separate "modules" connected by patch cables. This approach offers
                        unparalleled creative freedom, allowing you to design sounds that are impossible with
                        traditional fixed-architecture synths.</p>

                    <h2>Core Concepts: The Big Three</h2>
                    <p>Every modular patch starts with these fundamental building blocks:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>VCO (Voltage Controlled Oscillator):</strong> The source of the sound. It generates
                            raw waveforms like Sine, Saw, or Square.</li>
                        <li><strong>VCF (Voltage Controlled Filter):</strong> The "tonal shaper." It removes frequencies
                            (usually high-end) to create "subtractive" synthesis.</li>
                        <li><strong>VCA (Voltage Controlled Amplifier):</strong> Controls the volume. In modular, you
                            don't just "turn up" a knob; you use an **Envelope Generator** to tell the VCA how the
                            volume should change over time (Attack, Decay, Sustain, Release).</li>
                    </ul>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2>VCV Rack: Your Free Gateway</h2>
                    <p>You don't need to spend thousands on hardware to learn modular. **VCV Rack** is a free,
                        open-source software that perfectly emulates the Eurorack hardware experience. It allows you to
                        download thousands of modules and build massive patches right on your computer.</p>

                    <h3>🔌 Modulation is Key</h3>
                    <p>The "magic" of modular happens when you connect a source (like an LFO) to a destination (like
                        filter cutoff). This creates movement and life in your sounds, moving away from static, "boring"
                        synth tones.</p>
