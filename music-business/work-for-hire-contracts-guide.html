                    <p>When you hire a session drummer to play on your track or an engineer to mix your song,
                        who owns the resulting audio? Without a written agreement, the answer might
                        surprise you. In the music industry, <strong>Work for Hire</strong> (WFH) is a
                        legal concept that determines the "author" and owner of a creative work.</p>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2>1. What is Work for Hire?</h2>
                    <p>Under US copyright law (and similarly in many other jurisdictions), a work is
                        considered "work for hire" if it is created by an employee within the scope of
                        their employment, or if it is specially commissioned under a written contract
                        stating it is a work for hire.</p>
                    <div
                        style="background: var(--bg-secondary); padding: 1.5rem; border-radius: var(--radius-lg); border-left: 4px solid var(--primary);">
                        <p><strong>The Key Outcome:</strong> In a WFH arrangement, the person who <em>pays</em>
                            for the work is legally considered the "author" and owner of the copyright, not the
                            person who physically created it.</p>
                    </div>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2>2. Why Artists and Labels Use WFH</h2>
                    <p>Labels and independent artists use WFH contracts to ensure they have "clean
                        ownership" of their master recordings. If a session singer's contribution isn't
                        Work for Hire, they could technically claim to be a joint author of the
                        recording, which could block you from licensing the song to a movie or
                        collecting full royalties.</p>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2>3. Essential Elements of a WFH Agreement</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Clear Language:</strong> The contract must explicitly state that the
                            contribution is a "Work Made for Hire."</li>
                        <li><strong>Assignment Clause:</strong> Just in case the work doesn't legally
                            qualify as WFH, a fallback clause should "assign" all rights to the
                            employer.</li>
                        <li><strong>Compensation:</strong> Clearly state the flat fee being paid in
                            exchange for the full ownership of rights.</li>
                    </ul>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2>4. When NOT to use WFH</h2>
                    <p>If you are collaborating with a co-writer or a producer who is bringing
                        significant creative ideas to the table and you've agreed to split royalties,
                        a WFH might not be appropriate. Instead, you would use a <strong>Split Sheet</strong>
                        or a <strong>Producer Agreement</strong> where rights are shared.</p>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2>Summary</h2>
                    <p>Protect your investment. Whenever you pay someone for a service in the studio,
                        ensure you have a signed agreement. Whether it's a simple WFH or a more
                        complex contract, knowing who owns the master is fundamental to building
                        a sustainable music career.</p>
