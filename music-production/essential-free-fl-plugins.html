                        From lush, endless halls to rhythmic delays, it can make any sound feel huge and ethereal.</p>

                        analyzer. It helps you catch frequency masking and ensures your low end is sitting precisely
                        where it should be.</p>

                        to scan your VST folders correctly. Pro tip: Create a "Favorites" list so you don't waste
                        time scrolling through hundreds of plugins in the middle of a creative flow.</p>
                </section>
