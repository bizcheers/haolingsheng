                <section title="The Big Picture">
                    <h2>The Battle of Ideologies</h2>
                    <p>Choosing a music distributor is the first major business decision an independent artist makes. In
                        2026, the market is crowded, but it still boils down to two giants with opposing philosophies:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>DistroKid:</strong> The "Subscription" Model. Pay one fee, upload everything. Fast,
                            cheap, and disposable.</li>
                        <li><strong>CD Baby:</strong> The "Legacy" Model. Pay per release, keep it up forever. Slower,
                            more expensive upfront, but stable.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Which one is right for you? The answer depends entirely on <strong>Volume</strong> and
                        <strong>Collaboration</strong>.</p>
                </section>

                <section id="pricing-model">
                    <h2>1. Pricing: The "Rent" vs. "Buy" Debate</h2>
                    <p>This is where the biggest difference lies. You need to do the math based on your release
                        schedule.</p>

                    <h3>DistroKid: Renting Your Catalogs</h3>
                    <p>DistroKid charges <strong>$22.99/year</strong> (Musician Plan) or <strong>$39.99/year</strong>
                        (Musician Plus). This allows for unlimited uploads. However, if you stop paying this annual
                        bill, <strong>your music is removed from Spotify</strong>. It is essentially "renting" shelf
                        space.</p>

                    <h3>CD Baby: Buying Your Shelf Space</h3>
                    <p>CD Baby charges roughly <strong>$9.99 per Single</strong> or <strong>$29.99 per Album</strong>
                        (prices vary by promotion tier). Once you pay this, you never have to pay again. Your music
                        stays up forever, even if you die or quit music.</p>

                    <div class="info-card note">
                        <h3>The Verdict on Price</h3>
                        <p><strong>DistroKid Wins</strong> if you release more than 3 songs a year. The "unlimited"
                            value is unbeatable for prolific artists.<br>
                            <strong>CD Baby Wins</strong> if you release one album every 5 years. Why pay an annual fee
                            for a dormant catalog?
                        </p>
                    </div>
                </section>

                <section id="royalties">
                    <h2>2. Royalties & Commission</h2>
                    <p>How much of your hard-earned money do they keep?</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>DistroKid:</strong> Keeps <strong>0%</strong>. You get 100% of your royalties.</li>
                        <li><strong>CD Baby:</strong> Keeps <strong>9%</strong>. You get 91% of your royalties.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>At first glance, DistroKid looks like the clear winner. But wait. If you are a small artist
                        earning $10/year in royalties, giving up 9% ($0.90) to CD Baby is cheaper than paying
                        DistroKid's $22.99 annual fee.</p>
                    <p>However, once you start hitting 100,000+ streams, that 9% commission becomes massive. If you earn
                        $10,000, CD Baby takes $900. DistroKid still only costs you $22.99. For successful artists, <a
                            href="distrokid-complete-guide.html">DistroKid's model</a> is mathematically superior.</p>

                    <h2>3. Speed & Features</h2>

                    <h3>Speed to Stores</h3>
                    <p><strong>DistroKid</strong> is the fastest distributor in the world, period. Your song can be on
                        Spotify in 24-48 hours. They have direct pipes and automation that CD Baby lacks.</p>
                    <p><strong>CD Baby</strong> has a rigorous manual review process. It often takes 1-2 weeks for your
                        music to go live. While frustrating, this manual review protects you from copyright strikes.</p>

                    <h3>Payment Splitting</h3>
                    <p>This is DistroKid's "Killer Feature." If you collaborate with another producer, DistroKid can
                        automatically split the royalties (e.g., 50/50) and send the money to each person directly.
                        <strong>CD Baby does not support automatic payment splitting.</strong> If you have
                        collaborators, CD Baby forces YOU to be the accountant, collecting the money and trying to pay
                        your friends via PayPal.</p>
                </section>

                <section id="support">
                    <h2>4. Customer Support</h2>
                    <p>Let's be honest: Both are struggling in 2026, but in different ways.</p>
                    <p><strong>DistroKid</strong> relies heavily on AI automation (the infamous "Dave" bot). Reaching a
                        human is difficult unless you know the specific tricks (see our <a
                            href="distrokid-customer-service-support.html">DistroKid Support Guide</a>). However, their
                        automation means fewer errors happen in the first place.</p>
                    <p><strong>CD Baby</strong> offers phone support (sometimes) and email support with real humans, but
                        they are often overwhelmed and slow to respond. Their system is older and more prone to "human
                        error" during the manual review process.</p>

                    <h2>Final Recommendation</h2>

                    <h3>Choose DistroKid If:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>You are a Hip-Hop, Pop, or Electronic artist releasing signals often.</li>
                        <li>You collaborate with others and need automated royalty splits.</li>
                        <li>You want 100% of your potential viral earnings.</li>
                        <li>You want to see your music live ASAP.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Choose CD Baby If:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>You are a legacy artist (Jazz, Classical, Folk) releasing one masterpiece every few years.
                        </li>
                        <li>You want to "Set it and Forget it" and not worry about annual credit card renewals.</li>
                        <li>You perform cover songs extensively (CD Baby's cover licensing is slightly more robust for
                            albums).</li>
                    </ul>
