                    <p>Do your chord changes ever sound "clunky" or "jumpy"? The problem is likely a lack of
                        <strong>voice leading</strong>. In music theory, voice leading is the art of handling
                        individual melodic lines (voices) within a chord progression. In this guide, we'll
                        show you how to move between chords with elegance and logic.

                    <h2>1. Think in Layers, Not Blocks</h2>
                    <p>Instead of thinking of a chord progression as a series of solid "blocks" that jump
                        around, imagine three or four separate singers. One sings the high part, one the mid,
                        and one the low. Good voice leading ensures that each "singer" has a smooth, logical
                        melodic path from one chord to the next.</p>

                <section>
                    <h2>2. The Law of the Shortest Path</h2>
                    <p>The golden rule of voice leading is to move each part the shortest possible distance.
                        If a note exists in both chords, <strong>keep it where it is</strong> (common tone).
                        If a note must move, try to move it by only a half-step or a whole-step.</p>
                    <div class="info-card">
                        <h4>Why it Matters:</h4>
                        <p>Small movements sound cohesive and unified. Large jumps in every voice create a
                            disjointed, "beginner" sound that distracts from the melody.</p>

                <section>
                    <h2>3. Contrary Motion is King</h2>
                    <p>If all your voices move in the same direction at once, the harmony can feel weak. By
                        moving some parts up while others move down (contrary motion), you create "independence"
                        and richness in your sound. This is a hallmark of professional jazz and classical writing.</p>

                    <h2>4. Practical Tips for Piano & DAWs</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Use Inversions:</strong> Don't play every chord in "root position." Using
                            the nearest inversion is the easiest way to achieve perfect voice leading.</li>
                        <li><strong>The 3-Note Rule:</strong> You don't always need 4 or 5 notes in every chord.
                            Often, just the 3rd and 7th (the "guide tones") are enough to imply the harmony smoothly.

                    <h2>Summary</h2>
                    <p>Voice leading transforms a simple list of chords into a living, breathing arrangement.
                        By following the paths of individual voices, you ensure your music feels fluid,
                        emotional, and sophisticated.</p>

                    <h4>Pro Trick</h4>
                    <p>Try singing each individual note of a chord progression one by one. If you find a part
                        that is hard to sing or has a massive jump, that's where your voice leading needs
                        work.</p>
