                    <h2>The "Un-Production" Tool</h2>
                    <p>RipX DAW isn't a traditional digital audio workstation; it's a **spectral editor**. While
                        traditional DAWs treat audio as flat waveforms, RipX breaks audio down into its fundamental
                        harmonic components, allowing you to edit it as if it were MIDI.</p>

                    <h2>Note-Based Spectral Editing</h2>
                    <p>Once you import a stereo file into RipX, it uses AI to "rip" the track into layers. You can then:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Pitch Correct Individual Notes:</strong> Fix a flat note in a recorded vocal without
                            affecting the backing instruments.</li>
                        <li><strong>Change Melodies:</strong> Click and drag the notes of a guitar solo to create a
                            completely new melody from existing audio.</li>
                        <li><strong>Clean Up Noise:</strong> Surgically remove unwanted sounds (like a door slam) from a
                            recording by deleting its spectral signature.</li>
                    </ul>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2>Workflow: From Stereo to Stem</h2>
                    <p>RipX excels at taking a completed "master" and turning it back into a project file. For remixers,
                        this is the ultimate tool for extracting high-fidelity acapellas and instrumentals that
                        traditional phase-cancellation can't reach.</p>

                    <h3>🎹 MIDI Export</h3>
                    <p>You can export the "ripped" notes as MIDI files. This is perfect for analyzing complex jazz
                        chords or classical arrangements that are too difficult to transcribe by ear.</p>
