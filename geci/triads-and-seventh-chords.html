                    <h2>The Magic of Harmony</h2>
                    <p>If melody is the "story" of a song, harmony (chords) is the "world" that story lives in. Chords
                        set the mood, provide the foundation, and make music feel full. But how do we actually build
                        them? If you've already explored our guides on the <a href="major-scale-explained.html">major
                            scale</a> and <a href="what-is-interval.html">intervals</a>, you have everything you need to
                        become a chord-building pro.</p>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2>What is a Triad?</h2>
                    <p>A "triad" is the simplest type of chord. As the name suggests, it consists of exactly
                        <strong>three notes</strong>. These notes aren't picked at random; they are built by stacking
                        "thirds" on top of each other. Every triad has a Root, a Third, and a Fifth.</p>

                    <h3>The Four Main Triads</h3>
                    <p>Depending on the types of thirds you stack, you get different "flavors" of triads. The two most
                        common ones are Major and Minor.</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Major Triad:</strong> Root + Major 3rd + Perfect 5th. (Sounds bright, happy,
                            stable).</li>
                        <li><strong>Minor Triad:</strong> Root + Minor 3rd + Perfect 5th. (Sounds dark, sad,
                            mysterious).</li>
                        <li><strong>Diminished Triad:</strong> Root + Minor 3rd + Diminished 5th. (Sounds tense,
                            unstable).</li>
                        <li><strong>Augmented Triad:</strong> Root + Major 3rd + Augmented 5th. (Sounds dreamy,
                            suspended).</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Try it yourself: To build a <strong>C Major Triad</strong>, take the 1st, 3rd, and 5th notes of
                        the C Major scale: <strong>C - E - G</strong>.</p>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2>Leveling Up: Seventh Chords</h2>
                    <p>Triads are great, but sometimes they can sound a bit "basic." If you want to add sophistication,
                        jazziness, or more emotional weight, you add another note on top: <strong>the seventh</strong>.
                        This results in a four-note chord called a "Seventh Chord."</p>

                    <h3>Common Seventh Chords</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Major 7th (Maj7):</strong> Major Triad + Major 7th. (Sounds lush, dreamy, romantic).
                            Imagine a "C Maj7": C-E-G-B.</li>
                        <li><strong>Dominant 7th (7):</strong> Major Triad + Minor 7th. (Sounds bluesy, wants to
                            resolve). Imagine a "C7": C-E-G-Bb. This is the cornerstone of <a
                                href="chord-progressions-explained.html">blues and rock progressions</a>.</li>
                        <li><strong>Minor 7th (m7):</strong> Minor Triad + Minor 7th. (Sounds mellow, soulful,
                            sophisticated). Imagine a "Cm7": C-Eb-G-Bb.</li>
                        <li><strong>Minor Major 7th (m/Maj7):</strong> Minor Triad + Major 7th. (The "James Bond" chord
                            - very mysterious!).</li>
                    </ul>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2>Why Use Seventh Chords?</h2>
                    <p>Adding that fourth note creates more interaction between the frequencies. In a <strong>Major 7th
                            chord</strong>, the tension between the Root and the Major 7th (a half-step away from the
                        octave) creates a beautiful "shimmer" that you don't get with a simple triad.</p>

                    <p>In songwriting, switching from a basic C chord to a C Maj7 can instantly change the vibe from a
                        simple nursery rhyme to a professional-sounding ballad.</p>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2>How to Practice Chord Building</h2>
                    <p>The best way to learn is by doing. Pick a note, find its major scale, and try building the triad
                        and the various seventh chords for that note.
                    <ol>
                        <li>Start with the "Big Three": C, G, and F major.</li>
                        <li>Master the fingering on your instrument for triads first.</li>
                        <li>Experiment by adding the 7th note and noticing how the emotional color changes.</li>
                        <li>Try playing through some common <a href="chord-progressions-explained.html">chord
                                progressions</a> using seventh chords instead of triads.</li>
                    </ol>
                    </p>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
                    <p>Don't be intimidated by the number of chord types out there. Even the most complex jazz chords
                        are just extensions of these basic building blocks. If you understand triads and seventh chords,
                        you have the foundation of 99% of western music.</p>

                    <p>Next time you're writing a song or learning a cover, look at the chords. Is it a simple triad? Or
                        does it have that extra 7th note? Understanding <em>why</em> a chord sounds the way it does is
                        the first step toward true musical freedom. Happy playing!</p>
