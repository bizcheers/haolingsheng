                    <h2>Understanding Intervals</h2>
                    <p>An interval is simply the distance between two notes. That's it! Whether you're playing two notes
                        at the same time (harmonic interval) or one after the other (melodic interval), the space
                        between them is what we call an interval. It's one of the most fundamental concepts in music
                        theory, and once you get it, so much else starts to make sense.</p>

                    <p>Think of intervals as the building blocks of melody and harmony. Every chord is made up of
                        intervals, every melody moves through intervals, and understanding them helps you hear music in
                        a whole new way.</p>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2>How Intervals Are Measured</h2>
                    <p>Intervals are measured in two ways: by the number of letter names they span, and by the exact
                        number of half steps (semitones) between them.</p>

                    <h3>Counting Letter Names</h3>
                    <p>The first step is counting the letter names from your starting note to your ending note,
                        including both notes. For example:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>C to D = 2nd (C, D = 2 letters)</li>
                        <li>C to E = 3rd (C, D, E = 3 letters)</li>
                        <li>C to G = 5th (C, D, E, F, G = 5 letters)</li>
                        <li>C to C (octave higher) = 8th (C, D, E, F, G, A, B, C = 8 letters)</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Quality Matters Too</h3>
                    <p>But here's where it gets interesting—not all 3rds are the same! The exact distance in half steps
                        determines the interval's quality. That's why we have terms like "major 3rd" or "perfect 5th."
                        The quality describes the specific flavor of that interval.</p>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2>The Five Interval Qualities</h2>

                    <h3>Perfect Intervals</h3>
                    <p>Some intervals are called "perfect" because they have a very stable, consonant sound. These are
                        the unison (same note), 4th, 5th, and octave.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Perfect Unison:</strong> 0 half steps (same note)</li>
                        <li><strong>Perfect 4th:</strong> 5 half steps (C to F)</li>
                        <li><strong>Perfect 5th:</strong> 7 half steps (C to G)</li>
                        <li><strong>Perfect Octave:</strong> 12 half steps (C to C)</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Major and Minor Intervals</h3>
                    <p>2nds, 3rds, 6ths, and 7ths can be either major or minor. Major intervals are one half step larger
                        than their minor counterparts.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Minor 2nd:</strong> 1 half step (C to Db) - very tense</li>
                        <li><strong>Major 2nd:</strong> 2 half steps (C to D) - whole step</li>
                        <li><strong>Minor 3rd:</strong> 3 half steps (C to Eb) - sad sound</li>
                        <li><strong>Major 3rd:</strong> 4 half steps (C to E) - happy sound</li>
                        <li><strong>Minor 6th:</strong> 8 half steps (C to Ab)</li>
                        <li><strong>Major 6th:</strong> 9 half steps (C to A)</li>
                        <li><strong>Minor 7th:</strong> 10 half steps (C to Bb)</li>
                        <li><strong>Major 7th:</strong> 11 half steps (C to B)</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Augmented and Diminished</h3>
                    <p>When you raise a major or perfect interval by a half step, it becomes augmented. When you lower a
                        minor or perfect interval by a half step, it becomes diminished.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Diminished 5th:</strong> 6 half steps (C to Gb) - the "tritone"</li>
                        <li><strong>Augmented 4th:</strong> 6 half steps (C to F#) - also a tritone!</li>
                    </ul>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2>Harmonic vs. Melodic Intervals</h2>

                    <h3>Harmonic Intervals</h3>
                    <p>When you play two notes at the same time, that's a harmonic interval. This is what you hear in
                        chords and harmony. Harmonic intervals create the vertical structure of music.</p>

                    <h3>Melodic Intervals</h3>
                    <p>When you play two notes one after the other, that's a melodic interval. This is what creates
                        melodies and bass lines. Melodic intervals are the horizontal movement in music.</p>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2>Consonance and Dissonance</h2>
                    <p>Intervals can be classified as either consonant (stable, pleasant) or dissonant (tense, wanting
                        to resolve). Both are essential—dissonance creates tension, and consonance provides release.</p>

                    <h3>Consonant Intervals</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Perfect unison, 4th, 5th, and octave</li>
                        <li>Major and minor 3rds</li>
                        <li>Major and minor 6ths</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Dissonant Intervals</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Major and minor 2nds</li>
                        <li>Major and minor 7ths</li>
                        <li>All augmented and diminished intervals</li>
                    </ul>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2>Practical Applications</h2>

                    <h3>Building Chords</h3>
                    <p>Chords are just stacks of intervals! A major chord is built with a major 3rd and a perfect 5th
                        above the root. A minor chord uses a minor 3rd and perfect 5th.</p>

                    <h3>Playing by Ear</h3>
                    <p>When you can recognize intervals by ear, you can figure out melodies and chord progressions just
                        by listening.</p>

                    <h3>Improvisation</h3>
                    <p>Understanding intervals helps you navigate the fretboard or keyboard when improvising. It gives
                        you much more flexibility than just memorizing patterns.</p>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2>Interval Training Tips</h2>

                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Use Song References:</strong> Associate each interval with a familiar song. (e.g.,
                            Perfect 4th = "Here Comes the Bride").</li>
                        <li><strong>Practice Daily:</strong> Spend 5-10 minutes a day on interval recognition.</li>
                        <li><strong>Sing Intervals:</strong> Singing develops your inner ear much faster than just
                            listening.</li>
                        <li><strong>Start with Perfect Intervals:</strong> Master these first before moving on to major
                            and minor ones.</li>
                    </ol>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2>Wrapping It Up</h2>
                    <p>Intervals are everywhere in music—literally every note you play creates an interval with the
                        notes around it. Once you start hearing them, you'll start noticing them in your favorite songs
                        and understanding how melodies work.</p>

                    <p>Don't try to memorize everything at once. Start with the perfect intervals, get really
                        comfortable with those, then gradually add the major and minor ones. Before you know it, you'll
                        be identifying intervals by ear and using them to learn songs faster and improvise better.</p>
