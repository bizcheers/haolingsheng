                    <h2>Routing for Success</h2>
                    <p>Understanding the difference between **Inserts** and **Sends (Aux/Return)** is one of the most
                        important milestones for a beginner producer. Using the wrong routing can lead to muddy mixes
                        and a lack of control over your effects.</p>

                <section>
                    <h2>Inserts: The "Series" Connection</h2>
                    <p>An Insert is placed directly in the signal path of a track. 100% of the audio goes through the
                        effect. This is for processes that **change the fundamental character** of the sound:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>EQ:</strong> You want to shape the whole sound.</li>
                        <li><strong>Compression:</strong> You want to control the dynamics of the entire signal.</li>
                        <li><strong>Distortion/Saturation:</strong> You are changing the texture of the source.</li>
                    </ul>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2>Sends: The "Parallel" Connection</h2>
                    <p>A Send takes a "copy" of the audio and sends it to a separate "Aux" track. You then blend this
                        processed copy back with the original dry signal. This is for **spatial and time-based
                        effects**:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Reverb:</strong> This allows you to place multiple instruments in the same "room."
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Delay:</strong> You can keep the dry vocal clear while the echoes sit in the
                            background.</li>
                        <li><strong>Parallel Compression:</strong> As discussed in our Parallel Processing guide!</li>
                    </ul>
                </section>

                    <h3>💡 The "Bus" Secret</h3>
                    <p>Using Sends for reverb and delay saves CPU power because you only need one instance of the plugin
                        for multiple tracks. It also creates a more "cohesive" mix by making all instruments sound like
                        they are in the same physical space.</p>
