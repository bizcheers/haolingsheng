                <section>
                    <p>Reverb is the sound of an environment. It is what happens when a sound wave bounces off the
                        walls, ceiling, and floor of a room before reaching your ears. In music production,
                        <strong>Reverb</strong> is the primary tool for creating a sense of distance, size, and emotion.
                    </p>
                    <p>However, many beginners make the mistake of just picking a random preset. To get a professional
                        mix, you need to understand that different types of reverb serve different purposes. In this
                        guide, we break down the five most common types of reverb and when to use them.</p>
                </section>

                <section id="room">
                    <h2>1. Room Reverb</h2>
                    <p>As the name suggests, this mimics the sound of a natural, small room. It is characterized by
                        short decay times (usually under 1 second) and very realistic "early reflections."</p>
                    <p><strong>When to use it:</strong> Use Room reverb when you want an instrument to feel "real" and
                        "present" but not obviously "wet." It is perfect for acoustic guitars, drums, and dry vocals. It
                        provides "glue" without washing out the sound.</p>
                </section>

                <section id="hall">
                    <h2>2. Hall Reverb</h2>
                    <p>Hall reverb mimics large concert halls or cathedrals. It has a long decay time (2 - 5 seconds)
                        and a "majestic" quality. It is designed to sustain a sound and make it feel epic.</p>
                    <p><strong>When to use it:</strong> Use Hall reverb for orchestral elements, slow piano pieces, or
                        "ethereal" backing vocals. <strong>Warning:</strong> Be careful with Halls in a fast Trap or
                        Rock mix—they can quickly turn your track into a muddy mess.</p>
                </section>

                <section id="plate">
                    <h2>3. Plate Reverb</h2>
                    <p>Unlike Rooms or Halls, Plate reverb doesn't mimic a real-world space. It was created in the 1950s
                        using a literal giant metal plate. It has a bright, smooth, and "shimmery" sound that doesn't
                        have much low-end.</p>
                    <p><strong>When to use it:</strong> This is the <strong>Gold Standard for Vocals</strong> and
                        <strong>Snare Drums</strong>. Because it is bright and lacks low-end "mud," it adds height and
                        gloss to a voice without interfering with the kick drum or bass.</p>
                </section>

                <section id="spring">
                    <h2>4. Spring Reverb</h2>
                    <p>Spring reverb uses a vibrating metal spring. It has a very distinct "boingy" or "chirpy" sound.
                        It is not realistic, but it is highly emotional and nostalgic.</p>
                    <p><strong>When to use it:</strong> Essential for <strong>Electric Guitars</strong> (Surf Rock,
                        Blues, and Indie). It is also great for creating "dub" or "reggae" style delays and reverbs.</p>
                </section>

                <section id="convolution">
                    <h2>5. Convolution Reverb</h2>
                    <p>While the other four are "algorithmic" (mathematical simulations), Convolution reverb uses
                        <strong>Impulse Responses (IR)</strong>. These are literal recordings of real spaces (like the
                        Sydney Opera House or a famous vintage studio). If you want 100% realism, this is the tool.</p>
                    <p><strong>When to use it:</strong> Use this for film scoring, Foley, or when you specifically want
                        the sound of a legendary piece of hardware that you can't afford.</p>
                </section>

                <section id="pro-tips">
                    <h2>Mixing Tips for Better Reverb</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>EQ Your Reverb:</strong> Always put an EQ after your reverb. Use a High-Pass Filter
                            to cut everything below 200Hz (the "Abbey Road" trick). This prevents your reverb from
                            making the mix muddy.</li>
                        <li><strong>Pre-Delay is Key:</strong> Pre-delay is the gap between the original sound and the
                            start of the reverb. Adding 20ms - 50ms of Pre-delay on a vocal allows the "dry" voice to
                            stay clear before the reverb kicks in.</li>
                        <li><strong>Use a Send:</strong> Never put reverb directly on your track. Put it on a "Bus"
                            (Send/Return) and send your instruments to it. This allows multiple instruments to share the
                            same "room," which makes the mix feel more cohesive.</li>
                    </ul>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2>Summary</h2>
                    <p>Choosing a reverb is about deciding where you want the listener to be. Do you want them in a
                        small jazz club (Room)? A majestic cathedral (Hall)? Or do you want a shimmering, stylized pop
                        sound (Plate)? Learn these characteristics, and you will never pick a random preset again.</p>

                    <p>The "Decay" or "Reverb Time" (RT60) is how long it takes for the reverb to die down by 60
                        decibels. Faster songs need shorter decay times!</p>

                    <h4>The "Wet/Dry" Rule</h4>
                    <p>If you are using a Bus, keep the Reverb plugin at <strong>100% Wet</strong>. You control the
                        amount of reverb using the Send knob on your instrument track.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="sidebar-card">
                    <h4>Modern Secret</h4>
                    <p>Try <strong>Gated Reverb</strong> on your 80s-style snare drums. It's a huge reverb that is
                        suddenly cut off by a noise gate, creating that "Phil Collins" punch.</p>
