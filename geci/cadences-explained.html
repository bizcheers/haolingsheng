                <section>
                    <p>Just as a sentence needs a period, a comma, or a question mark to make sense, a musical
                        phrase needs a <strong>cadence</strong>. A cadence is a two-chord progression that
                        concludes a phrase, section, or an entire piece of music. In this guide, we'll break
                        down the four main types of cadences and the "feeling" each one creates.</p>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2>1. Authentic Cadence (The Period)</h2>
                    <p>The Authentic Cadence is the strongest and most final. It consists of the <strong>V
                            (Dominant)</strong>
                        chord moving to the <strong>I (Tonic)</strong>. It feels like a logical conclusion—a
                        definitive "end of the story."</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Perfect Authentic Cadence (PAC):</strong> The strongest version, where both chords
                            are in root position and the tonic is the highest note.</li>
                        <li><strong>Imperfect Authentic Cadence (IAC):</strong> A slightly softer version where one of
                            the chords is inverted or the tonic is not the highest note.</li>
                    </ul>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2>2. Half Cadence (The Question Mark)</h2>
                    <p>A Half Cadence ends on the <strong>V (Dominant)</strong> chord. It feels unfinished,
                        stable but incomplete—as if the music is asking a question and waiting for an answer.
                        It's most commonly used at the end of the first half of a musical section.</p>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2>3. Plagal Cadence (The "Amen")</h2>
                    <p>Commonly found at the end of hymns, the Plagal Cadence moves from the <strong>IV
                            (Subdominant)</strong>
                        to the <strong>I (Tonic)</strong>. It has a gentle, peaceful resolution. It doesn't have
                        the same "push" as the Authentic cadence because it lacks the leading tone (the 7th degree)
                        resolving to the tonic.</p>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2>4. Deceptive Cadence (The Plot Twist)</h2>
                    <p>A Deceptive Cadence begins like an Authentic cadence (starting on <strong>V</strong>)
                        but instead of going to <strong>I</strong>, it goes somewhere else—most often
                        to <strong>vi</strong>. It "deceives" the listener's ear, extending the music and
                        adding dramatic surprise.</p>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2>Summary</h2>
                    <p>Understanding cadences is key to creating structural flow in your music. By choosing the
                        right "punctuation," you control the listener's sense of tension, resolution, and
                        arrival.</p>

                    <p>Next time you listen to a pop song, notice how the verse often ends on a "Half Cadence"
                        (V chord) to build tension right before the chorus explodes on the Tonic.</p>
