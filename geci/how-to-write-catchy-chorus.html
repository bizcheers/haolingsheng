                    <p>The chorus is the heart of your song. It's the part people hum in the shower, the part
                        crowds sing back at concerts, and the part that determines if a song is a hit. But why
                        do some choruses stick while others are forgotten? In this guide, we explore the
                        <strong>songwriting tips</strong> and structural secrets for writing a chorus that
                        refuses to leave your head.
                    </p>

                    <h2>1. The Hero: The Melodic Hook</h2>
                    <p>A "hook" is a short, memorable melodic phrase. Most catchy choruses rely on a hook that is
                        <strong>simple and repetitive</strong>. If it's too complex, the listener's brain won't
                        be able to "store" it on the first listen.
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Try to keep your main chorus melody within a 5-note range (Pentatonic).
                        This makes it easier for everyone to sing along.</p>

                <section>
                    <h2>2. Power in Repetition</h2>
                    <p>Don't be afraid to repeat yourself. In pop music, the title of the song is often repeated
                        multiple times in the chorus. This builds familiarity and reward in the listener's ear.</p>
                    <div class="info-card">
                        <h4>Common Repetition Patterns:</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>AAA:</strong> The same hook three times.</li>
                            <li><strong>AABA:</strong> A hook, a repeat, a variation, and the hook again.</li>
                            <li><strong>Call and Response:</strong> One line followed by a "response" (often an
                                instrument or a harmony).</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2>3. Structural Contrast</h2>
                    <p>The chorus should feel like an "arrival." To make it jump out, it must offer contrast to
                        the verse:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Pitch:</strong> The chorus is usually higher in pitch than the verse.</li>
                        <li><strong>Rhythm:</strong> Use longer, sustained notes in the chorus if the verse is choppy
                            and rhythmic.</li>
                        <li><strong>Density:</strong> The chorus should feel "bigger" (more instruments, thicker
                            harmonies).</li>
                    </ul>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2>4. Lyrical Focus: The "Big Idea"</h2>
                    <p>If the verse is for the details and the story, the chorus is for the <strong>emotion and the
                            summary</strong>. Use universal themes like love, loss, victory, or escape. The lyrics
                        should be simple enough for a 10-year-old to understand but deep enough for an adult to
                        feel.</p>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2>Summary</h2>
                    <p>Writing a great chorus is about balancing novelty with familiarity. By mastering the
                        hook, utilizing smart repetition, and ensuring strong contrast, you create a musical
                        moment that listeners will want to experience over and over again.</p>

                    <h4>The "Nursery Rhyme" Test</h4>
                    <p>If you can't whistle your chorus melody, it's probably too complicated. Simplify until it
                        feels as natural as a childhood rhyme.</p>
