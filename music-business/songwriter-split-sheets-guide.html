                    <p>Collaborating can be the most rewarding part of music, but it can also be the most complicated.
                        If you write a song with a friend and it becomes a hit, how do you prove you own your
                        share of the royalties? The answer is a <strong>songwriter split sheet</strong>. In this
                        guide, we explain why this simple document is the most important piece of paper in your
                        career.</p>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2>1. What is a Split Sheet?</h2>
                    <p>A split sheet is a simple written agreement that identifies each contributor to a song and
                        specifies their ownership percentage of the underlying <strong>composition</strong>.</p>
                    <p><strong>Crucial Note:</strong> This is separate from the Master recording ownership. We are
                        talking about the "song" (lyrics and melody).</p>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2>2. Why You Need One (Now, Not Later)</h2>
                    <p>Many artists wait until a song is successful to discuss "splits." This is a mistake. Memories
                        fade, and money can ruin friendships. Filling out a split sheet <em>during</em> the
                        session ensures everyone is on the same page while the creative vibe is high.</p>

                    <h2>3. Everything a Split Sheet Must Include</h2>
                    <div class="info-card">
                        <h4>Essential Fields:</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Date and Song Title:</strong> The basic context.</li>

                            <li><strong>Ownership Percentage:</strong> (e.g., 50/50, 33/33/33).</li>

                    <h2>4. How to Handle "Fair" Splits</h2>
                    <p>There is no "lawful" way to split a song, but some common patterns include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>The Nashville Split:</strong> Everyone in the room gets an equal share, regardless
                            of who did what.</li>
                        <li><strong>Lyrics vs. Melody:</strong> Often split 50% for words and 50% for music.</li>
                        <li><strong>The Beatmaker Share:</strong> In Hip Hop, the producer often gets 50% of the
                            composition.</li>
                    </ul>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2>Summary</h2>
                    <p>Don't be afraid to have the "business talk." Professional songwriters use split sheets
                        for every single session. It protects your rights, your friendship, and your future income.</p>
