    <h2>What's That Number at the Start?</h2>
    <p>If you've ever looked at a piece of music, you've probably noticed two numbers stacked on top of each other right at the beginning—often a 4 over another 4. This is the <strong>4/4 time signature</strong>, and it's the most widely used rhythm in Western music. In fact, it's so pervasive that we often call it "Common Time."</p>
    <p>But what do those numbers actually mean? And why did we settle on 4/4 as our "default" rhythm? Let's break it down in a way that actually makes sense.</p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Decoding the Numbers</h2>
    <p>Think of a time signature like a fraction that tells you the rules of a musical "room" (called a measure). In 4/4 time:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>The Top 4 (The Count)</strong>: This tells you <em>how many</em> beats are in one measure. In 4/4, there are four beats per measure.</li>
        <li><strong>The Bottom 4 (The Note Value)</strong>: This tells you <em>what kind</em> of note gets one beat. A '4' on the bottom stands for a quarter note.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>So, 4/4 time literally means: <strong>Four quarter-note beats per measure.</strong> It's like a steady heartbeat: 1 - 2 - 3 - 4, 1 - 2 - 3 - 4.</p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Feeling the Pulse</h2>
    <p>Music isn't just about counting; it's about feeling. In 4/4 time, not all beats are created equal. There's a natural pulse that gives it its character:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Beat 1 (The Downbeat)</strong>: The strongest beat. This is where you naturally want to tap your foot or nod your head.</li>
        <li><strong>Beat 2</strong>: A weak beat.</li>
        <li><strong>Beat 3</strong>: A "strong" beat, but not as strong as Beat 1.</li>
        <li><strong>Beat 4</strong>: A weak beat.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This "Strong-Weak-Medium-Weak" pattern is the secret sauce of thousands of pop, rock, and jazz songs. It feels balanced, stable, and incredibly easy for our brains to track.</p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Common Time Symbol (C)</h2>
    <p>Sometimes you won't even see the numbers 4/4. Instead, you'll see a large capital <strong>'C'</strong> where the numbers should be. Don't panic! This simply stands for "Common Time," which is just another way of writing 4/4. It's a historical carryover from old Italian notation systems, but it means exactly the same thing.</p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Why 4/4 Is Everywhere</h2>
    <p>Why is almost every pop song on the radio in 4/4? It's largely because it's so symmetrical. Four is a very "stable" number—it divides nicely into two groups of two. This symmetry makes it easy to dance to, easy to clap to, and easy to write melodies for. While other time signatures like 3/4 (waltz) or 5/4 (odd-meter) have their own beauty, 4/4 is the ultimate comfort zone for our ears.</p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>How to Practice Counting 4/4</h2>
    <p>Try this: Turn on a metronome or just a steady pop song. Tap your foot on the beats and count out loud: "One, Two, Three, Four." Notice how the 'One' always feels like a starting point. That stability is the hallmark of 4/4 time.</p>
