                    <p>In the physical world, a mechanical license was simple: a label paid a songwriter for
                        every CD or Vinyl manufactured. But in the streaming world, where millions of songs
                        are played every second, how does the money find its way to the right composer?
                        Enter <strong>Mechanical Licensing</strong> and the <strong>MLC</strong>.</p>
                </section>

                    <h2>1. What are Mechanical Royalties?</h2>
                    <p>Mechanical royalties are paid to songwriters and publishers for the
                        <em>reproduction</em> of a musical work. Every time your song is streamed on
                        Spotify, Apple Music, or Tidal, a digital "reproduction" occurs, and a mechanical
                        royalty is due.
                    </p>
                </section>

                    <h2>2. What is The MLC?</h2>
                    <p>The <strong>Mechanical Licensing Collective (The MLC)</strong> is a nonprofit
                        organization designated by the U.S. Copyright Office to collect and distribute
                        digital mechanical royalties. It was created by the Music Modernization Act
                        of 2018 to solve the problem of "unmatched" royalties—money that was sitting
                        in bank accounts because labels couldn't find the songwriters.</p>

                    <h2>3. The MLC vs. PROs (ASCAP/BMI)</h2>
                    <div
                        style="background: var(--bg-secondary); padding: 1.5rem; border-radius: var(--radius-lg); margin: 2rem 0;">
                        <p>This is a common point of confusion. Here is the split:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>PROs (ASCAP/BMI):</strong> Collect <em>Performance</em> Royalties
                                (radio, live venues, background music).</li>
                            <li><strong>The MLC:</strong> Collects <em>Mechanical</em> Royalties
                                (streaming, downloads).</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Crucial:</strong> To get all your money, you must be registered with BOTH.</p>
                    </div>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2>4. How to Register with The MLC</h2>
                    <p>If you are a self-published songwriter, you can register directly at
                        <em>themlc.com</em>. You will need to provide your song metadata, including
                        ISWCs and songwriter shares. If you use a publishing administrator like
                        Songtrust or TuneCore Publishing, they usually handle this for you.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                    <p>The MLC has revolutionized how independent songwriters get paid. By understanding
                        how mechanical licensing works, you ensure that every stream of your music
                        contributes to your income. Don't leave your royalties "unclaimed"—get registered
                        today.</p>
