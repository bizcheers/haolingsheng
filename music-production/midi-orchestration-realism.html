                    <h2>Beyond the Keyboard</h2>
                    <p>Writing for a virtual orchestra requires a different mindset than playing a piano. To achieve
                        realism, you must treat every MIDI track as a living, breathing performer. If a violin note is
                        static, it sounds like a machine; if it "swells," it sounds like music.</p>

                <section>
                    <h2>The Secret Sauce: CC Automation</h2>
                    <p>The key to realistic strings, brass, and woodwinds is "Continuous Controller" (CC) automation.
                        The most important MIDI CC channels are:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>CC1 (Modulation):</strong> Usually controls dynamic crossfading (switching between
                            soft and loud samples).</li>
                        <li><strong>CC7 (Volume):</strong> Controls the overall level.</li>
                        <li><strong>CC11 (Expression):</strong> Used to add "swells" and dynamic movement *within* a
                            note.</li>
                    </ul>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2>Layering for Cinematic Impact</h2>
                    <p>Professional film scores rarely use just one sample library. To get a "Hollywood" sound, try
                        layering three different string libraries: one for the "attack" (shorts), one for the "lushness"
                        (longs), and one solo violin for the "detail."</p>

                    <h3>🎻 Humanization</h3>
                    <p>Avoid "quantizing" everything to 100%. Orchestras don't play perfectly on the beat. Shift your
                        MIDI notes slightly off the grid (humanize) to create that natural, slightly imperfect ensemble
                        feel.</p>
