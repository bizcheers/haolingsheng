                <section>
                    <p>The "Low End" is the engine of your track. If the kick and bass are weak, the song will never hit
                        the dancefloor or the radio with enough energy. However, the low end is also the hardest part of
                        a mix to get right because sub-frequencies (20Hz - 100Hz) are massive but incredibly difficult
                        to control.</p>
                    <p>In this guide, we'll explore the professional techniques for "slotting" your kick and bass so
                        they work as a single, powerful unit instead of a muddy mess.</p>
                </section>

                <section id="frequency-slotting">
                    <h2>1. Frequency Slotting: Giving Each a Home</h2>
                    <p>The biggest mistake in low-end mixing is letting both the kick and the bass fight for the
                        50Hz-60Hz region. You need to decide which one "owns" the sub-fundamental.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Scenario A:</strong> The Kick is the sub (huge, deep thump). Use a High-Pass Filter
                            on your Bass up to 80Hz.</li>
                        <li><strong>Scenario B:</strong> The Bass is the sub (deep 808 or synth bass). Choose a
                            "shorter" kick and use a High-Pass Filter on the kick up to 40Hz.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>By carving a hole in one for the other to live in, you immediately add 50% more clarity to your
                        mix.</p>
                </section>

                <section id="phase">
                    <h2>2. Phase Alignment</h2>
                    <p>Low frequency sound waves are very long. If your kick drum hits at the same time as your bass,
                        but one wave is "up" and the other is "down," they will <strong>cancel each other out</strong>.
                        This makes your low end sound hollow and weak, no matter how much you boost the EQ.</p>
                    <p><strong>The Fix:</strong> Zoom in on your waveform. If the peak of the kick is going up, make
                        sure the start of the bass wave is also going up. Flip the "Phase/Polarity" button on your bass
                        track to see which setting sounds "thicker."</p>
                </section>

                <section id="sidechain">
                    <h2>3. Sidechain: The Rhythmic Space</h2>
                    <p>Even with perfect EQ, the kick and bass will still overlap. Use <strong>Sidechain
                            Compression</strong> to momentarily dip the volume of the bass by 3-6dB every time the kick
                        drum hits. This ensures the transient of the kick has 100% of the headroom it needs to punch
                        through.</p>
                </section>

                <section id="saturation">
                    <h2>4. Saturation for Translation</h2>
                    <p>Low-end energy is often invisible on small smartphone speakers or AirPods. To make your bass
                        audible on these devices, you need <strong>Harmonics</strong>.</p>
                    <p>By adding subtle <strong>Saturation</strong> or <strong>Distortion</strong> to your bass, you
                        create "copy" frequencies in the mid-range (200Hz - 500Hz). The human brain hears these
                        mid-range harmonics and "fills in" the missing sub-bass, making the bass feel powerful even on a
                        small speaker.</p>
                </section>

                <section id="mono">
                    <h2>5. Keep it Mono</h2>
                    <p>Always keep everything below 150Hz in <strong>Mono</strong>. Panning low frequencies creates
                        phase issues on large club systems and makes the mix feel unstable. Use a "Stereo Imager" to
                        narrow the low end to 0% width while keeping the mid-range and highs wide.</p>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2>Summary</h2>
                    <p>A great low end is a balance of science and feeling. Once you've slotted your frequencies and
                        aligned your phase, the "vibe" comes from how you blend the saturation and sidechain. Respect
                        the sub-frequencies, and they will respect your mix.</p>
                </section>

                    <h4>The "80-100" Trick</h4>
                    <p>Try a small 2dB boost at 60Hz on the Kick and a 2dB cut at 60Hz on the Bass. Then, do the
                        opposite at 100Hz. This "complimentary EQ" is magic.</p>

                    <h4>VCA Compression</h4>
                    <p>Use a VCA-style compressor (like an SSL Bus Comp) on your Drum + Bass group. This "glues" the low

                    <p>Don't trust your room for low end unless it has 2-foot thick bass traps. Always use <strong>Good
                            Headphones</strong> to check your final sub levels.</p>
