                <section>
                    <p>If you have spent any time in professional mixing circles lately, you have undoubtedly heard of
                        <strong>Soothe 2</strong> by oeksound. It has become a industry standard, almost "cheat-code"
                        style plugin that has replaced hours of surgical EQ work for top-tier engineers. But what
                        exactly does it do, and why should you care?</p>
                    <p>Unlike a standard equalizer that cuts a frequency and leaves it cut, Soothe 2 is a
                        <strong>dynamic resonance suppressor</strong>. It scans your audio in real-time, identifies
                        unpleasant resonances (those "whistling" or "honky" frequencies), and pulls them down—but only
                        when they are actually causing a problem. In this guide, we are going to look at the practical
                        ways to use Soothe 2 to get pro results.</p>
                </section>

                <section id="basics">
                    <h2>1. The Core Philosophy: Depth vs. Sharpness</h2>
                    <p>The biggest mistake beginners make with Soothe 2 is treating it like a volume knob. The most
                        important control in Soothe 2 is the <strong>Depth</strong> slider. This determines how much
                        suppression is happening across the entire spectrum.</p>
                    <p>The <strong>Sharpness</strong> and <strong>Selectivity</strong> knobs are the "brain" of the
                        plugin. <em>Sharpness</em> controls how narrow the suppression filters are (surgical vs. broad),
                        while <em>Selectivity</em> tells the plugin how much it should focus only on the most prominent
                        peaks. For most vocals, a medium Sharpness and high Selectivity will keep the voice sounding
                        natural while removing that harsh 2kHz-4kHz edge.</p>
                </section>

                <section id="vocals">
                    <h2>2. Fixing Harsh Vocals (The #1 Use Case)</h2>
                    <p>Modern "pop" vocals are often recorded with bright condenser microphones that can sound piercing
                        in the high-mids (3kHz - 7kHz). Using a standard EQ to dip these frequencies can make the vocal
                        sound "muffled" or "dark."</p>
                    <p><strong>Pro Workflow:</strong> Place Soothe 2 <em>after</em> your main compressor but
                        <em>before</em> your creative reverb. Engage the high-mid band and push the Depth until the
                        harshness disappears. Use the "Delta" button (the headphones icon) to listen only to what the
                        plugin is removing. If you hear actual "music" or "words" in the Delta signal, you are pushing
                        it too hard.</p>
                </section>

                <section id="sidechain">
                    <h2>3. The Secret Weapon: Sidechain Mode</h2>
                    <p>This is where Soothe 2 becomes legendary. Imagine your synth lead is fighting with your vocal for
                        space in the 1kHz range. Usually, you would use a sidechain compressor to duck the whole synth,
                        but that makes it "pump" and lose energy.</p>
                    <p><strong>The Fix:</strong> Put Soothe 2 on the synth track. Route your vocal into Soothe 2's
                        sidechain input. Now, Soothe 2 will only suppress the frequencies in the <em>synth</em> that are
                        present in the <em>vocal</em> at that exact moment. The result? The vocal cuts through
                        perfectly, but the synth stays loud and powerful. This is much more transparent than any dynamic
                        EQ or sidechain compressor.</p>
                </section>

                <section id="acoustic">
                    <h2>4. Taming Acoustic Guitars and Cymbals</h2>
                    <p>Acoustic guitars often have "boxiness" around 200Hz - 400Hz that changes depending on the chord
                        being played. Soothe 2 in "Soft" mode is perfect here. It will catch those resonant low-mid
                        build-ups without making the guitar sound thin during the quiet parts.</p>
                    <p>Similarly, for overheads or "harsh" drum rooms, use Soothe 2 to target the resonance of the snare
                        or the "clack" of the cymbals. It allows you to keep the brightness of the drums without the
                        ear-piercing pain.</p>
                </section>

                <section id="mastering">
                    <h2>5. Soothe 2 on the Master Bus?</h2>
                    <p>Yes, but proceed with extreme caution. Professional mastering engineers often use Soothe 2 to
                        target "digital harshness" or "buildup" in the high frequencies. However, on a master bus, you
                        should rarely see more than 1dB - 2dB of gain reduction.</p>
                    <p><strong>Settings:</strong> Use the "Soft" algorithm, low Sharpness, and keep the Mix at around
                        30% - 50%. This creates a subtle "smoothing" effect across the whole mix that makes the track
                        feel more like a record and less like a computer file.</p>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2>Common Pitfalls to Avoid</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Over-processing:</strong> If you use Soothe 2 on every track, your mix will start to
                            sound "lifeless" and "dull." Some resonances are part of the character of the instrument.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Ignoring the Envelope:</strong> The Attack and Release knobs matter. A fast attack
                            is great for transients (like a snare), but a slower release is better for smooth vocals.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Setting and Forgetting:</strong> Always A/B your changes. Sometimes the "harshness"
                            you think you hear is actually providing the "presence" needed to cut through a dense rock
                            mix.</li>
                    </ul>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2>Summary</h2>
                    <p>Soothe 2 is not a replacement for good recording techniques or basic EQ. However, it is the best
                        tool on the market for handling the "imperfections" of modern digital audio. Master the Depth
                        and Selectivity knobs, utilize the sidechain feature for mix clarity, and you will find that
                        your mixes sound significantly more polished and professional.</p>

                    <h4>The Soothe Chain</h4>
                    <p>For a modern pop vocal, try this order:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Correction (Pitch)</li>

                    <h4>Why "Soft" Mode?</h4>
                    <p>Use "Soft" mode for natural instruments (strings, vocals, piano). Use "Hard" mode only for
                        intense, aggressive sounds like heavy synths or distorted guitars.</p>

                    <h4>The Delta Button</h4>
                    <p>Always check the <em>Delta</em> signal. If you can hear the melody of the song clearly in the
                        Delta, you are removing too much of the fundamental frequency!</p>
