                    <p>The "Low End" is the most difficult part of a mix to get right. Too little, and your song
                        sounds thin; too much, and it becomes a muddy mess that lacks punch. The secret to a
                        powerful bottom end is understanding the difference between <strong>sub-bass</strong>
                        and <strong>mid-bass</strong>. In this guide, we'll show you how to separate them for a
                        professional, club-ready sound.</p>

                <section>
                    <h2>1. Defining the Zones</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Sub-Bass (20Hz - 60Hz):</strong> These are frequencies you <em>feel</em> more
                            than you hear. They provide the "weight" and "rumbly" energy. Most small speakers
                            can't even reproduce this range.</li>
                        <li><strong>Mid-Bass (60Hz - 250Hz):</strong> This is where the "punch" and "definition" live.
                            The fundamental notes of the kick drum and bass guitar usually sit here.</li>
                    </ul>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2>2. The "Frequency Slot" Method</h2>
                    <p>You cannot have two powerful elements fighting for the same exact frequency. You must
                        decide which instrument "owns" which zone:</p>
                    <div class="info-card">
                        <h4>Choosing Owners:</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Scenario A:</strong> The <strong>Kick Drum</strong> owns the Sub-Bass (deep
                                punch), while the <strong>Bass</strong> owns the Mid-Bass (melodic definition).</li>
                            <li><strong>Scenario B:</strong> The <strong>Bass</strong> owns the Sub-Bass (long, deep
                                notes), while the <strong>Kick</strong> owns the Mid-Bass (short, fast impact).</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Use EQ to cut a "hole" in one instrument to make room for the other.</p>
                    </div>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2>3. Saturation for Audibility</h2>
                    <p>As mentioned in our <a href="saturation-distortion-guide.html">Saturation Guide</a>, adding
                        harmonics to your sub-bass allows it to be heard on headphones and laptops by creating
                        "phantom" mid-range frequencies that our brain interprets as the deep fundamental.</p>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2>4. Compression & Control</h2>
                    <p>Sub-bass must be incredibly consistent. Any volume fluctuations will destroy the "vibe"
                        of a track. Use <strong>heavy limiting or surgical compression</strong> with a fast attack
                        to pin the sub-bass in place so it never jumps out or disappears.</p>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2>Summary</h2>
                    <p>Low-end clarity is about discipline. By assigning specific roles to your sub and mid frequencies,
                        utilizing sidechaining, and ensuring consistency, you ensure your mix has the physical
                        power to move a room and the clarity to translate anywhere.</p>

                    <h4>The High-Pass Rule</h4>
                    <p>Always high-pass (remove) everything that isn't the Kick or Bass below 100Hz. This
                        immediately frees up "headroom" for your low-end to shine.</p>
