                    <h2>What is Rhythm?</h2>
                    <p>In music, pitch (high and low notes) is only half the battle. The other half is
                        <strong>rhythm</strong>—the placement of sounds in time. Without rhythm, a melody is just a
                        purposeless string of notes. To read and write music, we need a universal "code" to describe how
                        long each note lasts. If you've already seen our guide on <a
                            href="../gepu/what-is-time-signature.html">time signatures</a>, this is the missing piece of
                        the puzzle.</p>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2>The Hierarchy of Note Values</h2>
                    <p>Music notation uses a simple system based on factors of two. Think of it like a pie chart:
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Whole Note (Semibreve):</strong> The "whole pie." In 4/4 time, it lasts for 4 beats.
                            It's an empty circle with no stem.</li>
                        <li><strong>Half Note (Minim):</strong> Half a whole note. Lasts for 2 beats. It's an empty
                            circle with a stem.</li>
                        <li><strong>Quarter Note (Crotchet):</strong> A quarter of a whole note. Lasts for 1 beat. It's
                            a filled circle with a stem.</li>
                        <li><strong>Eighth Note (Quaver):</strong> Half of a quarter note. Lasts for 0.5 beats. It has a
                            stem and a "flag" (or a "beam" if connected to others).</li>
                        <li><strong>Sixteenth Note (Semiquaver):</strong> Half of an eighth note. Lasts for 0.25 beats.
                            It has two flags or beams.</li>
                    </ul>
                    </p>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2>Rests: The Sound of Silence</h2>
                    <p>Silence is just as important as sound in music. For every note value, there is a corresponding
                        <strong>rest</strong> symbol that tells the musician exactly how long to stay quiet.
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Whole Rest:</strong> A small rectangle hanging "down" from the 4th line of the
                            staff.</li>
                        <li><strong>Half Rest:</strong> A small rectangle sitting "up" on the 3rd line of the staff.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Quarter Rest:</strong> A squiggly symbol that looks a bit like a lightning bolt.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Eighth Rest:</strong> A stem with one small flag or "hook."</li>
                    </ul>
                    </p>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2>Dots and Ties: Extending the Duration</h2>
                    <p>What if you want a note to last for 1.5 beats? Or 3 beats? We use two main tools:
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Dotted Notes:</strong> A small dot added to the right of a note increases its
                            duration by <strong>50%</strong>. A dotted half note (2 + 1) becomes 3 beats. A dotted
                            quarter note (1 + 0.5) becomes 1.5 beats.</li>
                        <li><strong>Ties:</strong> A curved line connecting two notes of the same pitch. This tells you
                            to play the first note and hold it for the duration of both notes combined. It's the only
                            way to hold a note across a bar line!</li>
                    </ul>
                    </p>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2>Rhythm and Time Signatures</h2>
                    <p>Rhythm doesn't exist in a vacuum; it lives inside a <a
                            href="../gepu/what-is-time-signature.html">time signature</a>. For example, in 4/4 time,
                        every measure (bar) must add up to exactly 4 beats.
                    <ul>
                        <li>One measure could be: 1 whole note.</li>
                        <li>Another could be: 2 quarter notes + 1 half note.</li>
                        <li>Another could be: 8 eighth notes.</li>
                    </ul>
                    The time signature is the "budget," and the note values are how you choose to spend it!</p>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2>How to Improve Your Rhythm</h2>
                    <p>Rhythm is a physical skill as much as a mental one.
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Use a metronome:</strong> It's the most important tool for any musician. Practice
                            simple scales using different note values.</li>
                        <li><strong>Master the subdividing:</strong> When playing eighth notes, count
                            "1-and-2-and-3-and-4-and." For sixteenths, "1-e-and-a, 2-e-and-a."</li>
                        <li><strong>Clap it out:</strong> Before you try to play a complex rhythm on your instrument,
                            clap it while counting out loud.</li>
                    </ol>
                    </p>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
                    <p>Learning note values is like learning the alphabet of music. At first, it might feel like math,
                        but soon it becomes second nature. Once you understand how these symbols work together, you'll
                        be able to read almost any piece of music and communicate your own musical ideas to others.
                        Rhythm is the heartbeat of your song—keep it steady, keep it interesting, and most importantly,
                        keep it grooving!</p>
