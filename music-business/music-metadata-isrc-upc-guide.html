                    <p>You've finished your track, it sounds amazing, and you're ready to upload it. But then your
                        distributor asks for your <strong>ISRC</strong> and <strong>UPC</strong>. If you don't
                        understand <strong>music metadata</strong>, you risk losing out on royalties and having
                        your music vanish into the digital void. In this guide, we break down the identifiers
                        that keep the music industry running.</p>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2>1. What is Music Metadata?</h2>
                    <p>Metadata is simply "data about data." In music, it's the digital information attached to
                        your audio file that tells streaming services (like Spotify) and stores who made the
                        music, who owns it, and where the money should go.</p>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2>2. The ISRC: The Digital Fingerprint</h2>
                    <p><strong>ISRC</strong> stands for <em>International Standard Recording Code</em>. It is a
                        unique 12-character code assigned to a specific <strong>recording</strong>.</p>

                    <div class="info-card">
                        <h4>Key ISRC Facts:</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Each version of a song (Original, Remix, Acoustic) needs its OWN ISRC.</li>
                            <li>A song keeps the same ISRC even if you change distributors.</li>
                            <li>The ISRC is how Spotify knows a stream of your song belongs to you.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2>3. The UPC: The Product Barcode</h2>
                    <p><strong>UPC</strong> stands for <em>Universal Product Code</em>. This is assigned to the
                        <strong>entire product</strong> (Single, EP, or Album).
                    </p>
                    <p>Think of it this way: The UPC is the box, and the ISRCs are the items inside the box.</p>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2>4. Essential Metadata Checklist</h2>
                    <p>When uploading, ensure these fields are 100% accurate:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Primary Artist:</strong> Your stage name.</li>
                        <li><strong>Song Title:</strong> No weird symbols or "Mastered" in the title.</li>
                        <li><strong>Composer/Songwriter:</strong> Full legal names (crucial for royalties).</li>
                        <li><strong>Genre:</strong> Helps with playlist placement.</li>
                        <li><strong>Release Date:</strong> Set this at least 3 weeks in advance.</li>
                    </ul>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2>Summary</h2>
                    <p>Clean metadata is the difference between a professional career and a hobby. By ensuring
                        your ISRCs and UPCs are correctly logged, you ensure that every stream is counted and
                        every royalty is paid.</p>
                </section>

                    <p>If you are re-releasing an old song, USE THE ORIGINAL ISRC. This preserves your play
