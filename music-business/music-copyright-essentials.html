                    <h2>Your Intellectual Property</h2>
                    <p>In the digital age, your songs are more than just art—they are assets. Understanding copyright is
                        the key to ensuring you are paid fairly and that your work isn't used without your permission.
                        If you're building a <a href="how-to-make-money-from-music.html">career in music</a>, you need
                        to understand the legal foundation of the industry. Let's demystify it together.</p>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2>What is a Copyright?</h2>
                    <p>Technically, you own the copyright the moment your song is <strong>"fixed in a tangible
                            medium."</strong> This means as soon as you record it into your <a
                            href="../music-production/what-is-daw.html">DAW</a> or write it down on paper, it's yours.
                        You don't <em>need</em> to register it to own it, but registration provides a public record and
                        much stronger legal protection if someone steals your work.</p>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2>The Two Types of Music Copyright</h2>
                    <p>As we discussed in our guide on <a href="songtrust-royalties-guide.html">Songtrust and
                            Royalties</a>, every song has two distinct copyrights:
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>PA Copyright (Performing Arts):</strong> Protects the composition (melody, lyrics,
                            song structure). This belongs to the songwriters and publishers.</li>
                        <li><strong>SR Copyright (Sound Recording):</strong> Protects the specific audio recording (the
                            "master"). This usually belongs to the record label or the independent artist who funded the
                            recording.</li>
                    </ul>
                    When someone "covers" your song, they are using your PA copyright but creating their own SR
                    copyright.</p>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2>The Myth of "Poor Man's Copyright"</h2>
                    <p>You may have heard that mailing a copy of your song to yourself in a sealed envelope is enough
                        protection. <strong>This is a myth.</strong> While it might provide a date stamp, it is not a
                        substitute for official registration and is rarely useful in a actual court of law. If your
                        music is generating revenue, use your country's official Copyright Office.</p>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2>Samples and Clearance</h2>
                    <p>If you use a loop or a direct sample from someone else's song, you are using their copyright. You
                        <strong>must</strong> get permission (clearance) before releasing the song.
                    <ul>
                        <li>Using 2 seconds of a song without permission is still copyright infringement.</li>
                        <li>Distributors like <a href="distrokid-complete-guide.html">DistroKid</a> will generally
                            takedown your music if a copyright holder makes a claim.</li>
                        <li>Royalty-free samples (from Splice, etc.) are legal because the clearance is built into the
                            purchase.</li>
                    </ul>
                    </p>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2>How to Protect Your Music</h2>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Document everything:</strong> Keep your project files, initial voice memos, and
                            lyrics drafts.</li>
                        <li><strong>Register with a PRO:</strong> Sign up with BMI or ASCAP to establish a public record
                            of your songwriting.</li>
                        <li><strong>Use a Publishing Admin:</strong> Services like <a
                                href="songtrust-royalties-guide.html">Songtrust</a> help register your works with
                            collection societies globally.</li>
                        <li><strong>Register with the Copyright Office:</strong> For your "hit" songs or full albums,
                            official registration is the only way to seek statutory damages in court.</li>
                    </ol>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
                    <p>Copyright isn't about being "greedy"—it's about protecting your hard work. It ensures you have
                        the right to decide how your music is used and that you are compensated for it. Take the time to
                        set up your business correctly from day one, and you'll have peace of mind as your music career
                        grows. Now go make some more hits!</p>
