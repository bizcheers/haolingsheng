                    <h2>A Sonic Phenomenon</h2>
                    <p>If you've listened to charts in the last two years, you've heard it: that deep, percussive, woody
                        bass that seems to "thump" rather than just hum. That is the **Log Drum**, the defining element
                        of South African **Amapiano**.</p>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <h2>What is it, really?</h2>
                    <p>In Amapiano, the "Log Drum" isn't an acoustic drum. It's a specific synthesis technique, often
                        created using Frequency Modulation (FM). Producers famously used the "Log Drum" preset in FL
                        Studio's **Fruity DX10** to create this iconic sound.</p>

                    <h2>How to Make It</h2>
                    <p>To recreate it in any synth, you need a quick pitch envelope on your oscillator. The pitch should
                        drop rapidly from a high frequency to a low one, creating that "knock" or "donk" sound. Pair
                        this with a sine-based FM operator for the weight, and you have the Amapiano soul.</p>
