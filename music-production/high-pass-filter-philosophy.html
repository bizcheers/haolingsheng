                    <h2>Clearing the Mud</h2>
                    <p>The High-Pass Filter (HPF) is the single most powerful tool for creating a clean, professional
                        mix. Most instruments (including vocals and guitars) contain low-frequency "rumble" that isn't
                        necessary for their sound but takes up valuable "headroom" in the mix.</p>

                <section>
                    <h2>The "High-Pass Everything" Myth</h2>
                    <p>While clearing the low-end is important, over-filtering can make a mix sound thin and "sterile."
                        The goal is to remove what is **unnecessary**, not what is **audible**.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Vocals:</strong> Usually safe to HPF up to 80Hz-120Hz.</li>
                        <li><strong>Guitars:</strong> Can often be cut up to 100Hz to make room for the bass.</li>
                        <li><strong>The 30Hz Rule:</strong> Many producers apply a steep HPF at 20Hz-30Hz on the entire
                            master bus to remove sub-sonic noise that speakers can't even reproduce.</li>
                    </ul>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2>Fixed vs. Dynamic HPF</h2>
                    <p>If a vocal sounds "thin" during some parts but "bassy" during others, use a **Dynamic EQ** or a
                        multiband compressor instead of a static HPF. This allows you to tame the proximity effect only
                        when it becomes a problem.</p>

                    <h3>🔊 Check Your Slopes</h3>
                    <p>Standard HPF slopes are 12dB/octave. For a more transparent sound, use 6dB. For surgical cleaning
                        of a kick drum, try a steeper 24dB or 48dB slope.</p>
